<ul>
	<li>Easy to build even in rough terrain.</li>
	<li>Economically cheaper than railways.</li>
	<li>Provides door-to-door service, thereby reducing the loading-unloading cost.</li>
	<li>Construction cost is lower than railways.</li>
	<li>Used as feeder to railways and airways.</li>
	<li>Easily maintainable.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Road Density</strong><strong>:-</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Length of road per 100 sq. km. area is called road density.</li>
	<li>Road Density in India: <strong>75 km.</strong></li>
	<li>Minimum density: Jammu and Kashmir (10 km) Maximum density: Kerala (375 km)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Classification of Roads</strong><strong>:-</strong>

<strong>Super Highways</strong><strong>:-</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Connect the mega cities of India.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>

Light as a form of energy enables one to see objects clearly. Rectilinear propagation, reflection, refraction are certain properties associated with it. Reflection can be from plane and/or spherical surfaces. Refraction from plane surface and spherical lenses are also possible. In this chapter we will learn about the phenomena in the nature and the properties of light. Nature of image formation and various optical phenomena in nature are also discussed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[summary text="

Reproductive processes give rise to new individuals that are similar but with some variations. Thus, the similarities between the parents and the offsprings are due to 'heredity' and the dissimilarities are due to 'variation'. Continuity of life is maintained through heredity and evolution. Heridity explains that organism resemble each other because they arise from common ansistor. Evolution is the orderly changes of various forms through a slow but a continuous process. It gives rise to more complex body designs even while simpler body designs continue to flourish.

<strong>Heredity</strong>
Transmission of characters (resemblances as well as variations) from parents to the offsprings, i.e., from one generation to the next is called heredity.

<strong>Variation</strong>
The differences shown by the individual of a species, and also by the offsprings (siblings) of the same parent are refferd to as variations.

<strong>Importance of Variations</strong>
<ul>
	<li>They enable organism to adapt themself in the changing environment.</li>
	<li>Variations form the basis of heredity.</li>
	<li>They form raw materials for the evolution and developement of new species.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Accumulation od Variation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>If one bacterium divides, then resultant two bacteria divide again, the four individual bacteria generated would be simi lar with minor differences due to small inaccuracies in DNA copying.</li>
	<li>Depending on the nature of variations, different individuals would have different advantages like bacteria, which can withstand heat will survive heat wave better.</li>
	<li>Selection of variants by environmental factors form the basis of evolutionary processes.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Heredity and Variation in Asexual Reproduction</strong>
<ul>
	<li>In asexual reproduction, organisms raised are the exact copies of their parents.</li>
	<li>They tend to preserve the similarities among all individuals belonging to a given line of descent.</li>
	<li>They exhibit very little variations due to some environmental factors or mutations which are sudden changes in genes. Outof these Two factors, only mutations are heritable.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Heredity and Variation in Sexual Reproduction</strong>
<ul>
	<li>In sexual reproduction, two parents are involved and there is formation and fusion of gametes.</li>
	<li>The offsprings show variations from their parents due to crossing over and exchange of gene segments.</li>
	<li>They are not carbon copies of their parents, due to recombination of parental genes. So, variations which occur areheritable.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Inherited Traits</strong>
It is the transmission of particular characteristics from parents to their offsprings, generation togeneration, which bear all basic features with great deal of variation. Inherited trait is a particular genetically determined characteristic that distinguishes a person.

<strong>Gregor Johann Mendel</strong>
<ul>
	<li>His experiments with garden peas (Pisum sativum) and the inferences together with his interpretationsconstitute the foundation of modern genetics.</li>
	<li>Mendel conducted his hybridization experiments in the garden behind the monastery.</li>
	<li>Mendel blended his knowledge of science and mathematics and was the first one to keep count of individuals exhibiting a particular trait in each generation.</li>
	<li>Mendel's experiments give us the mechanism for the inheritance of traits from one generation to the next.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Mendel's Experiment on Inheritance of Traits</strong>
Mendel used a number of contrasting visible characters of garden peas like round/wrinkled seeds, tall/short plants, white/voilet flowers, etc.

<strong>One visible contrasting character</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Mendel took pea plants with different characteristics as a tall plant and a short plant.</li>
	<li>The first generation or F1 progeny thus formed are all tall.</li>
	<li>Mendel then allowed the F1 progeny plants for self-pollination.</li>
	<li>The second generation or F2 progeny of the F1 tall plants are not all tall, some are short. This indicates thatboth tallness and shortness traits were inherited in F1 plants but only the tallness trait was expressed.</li>
	<li>Thus, two copies of the traits are inherited in each sexually reproducing organism.</li>
	<li>In the figure, both TT and Tt are tall plants, while onlytt is a short plant.</li>
	<li>A single copy of T is enough to make plant tall while both copies have to be ‘t ‘for the plant to beshort. Therefore, traits like 'T' are dominant traits while 't" recessive traits.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Two visible contrasting character</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Mendel took pea plants with two different characteristics such as a tall plant with round seeds and a short plant withwrinkled-seeds.</li>
	<li>F1 progeny are all tall with round seeds, thus, tallness and round seeds are dominant traits.</li>
	<li>F2 progeny are tall plants with round seeds and some short plants with wrinkled seeds.</li>
	<li>But some F2 progeny shows new mixtures like tall having wrinkled seeds and short having round seeds.</li>
	<li>Therefore, tall / short trait and round seed/ wrinkled seed trait sare independently inherited.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Control of Traits</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A section of DNA that provides information for one protein in cell is called gene for that protein.</li>
	<li>If the proteins work efficiently, the traits get expressed in abetter-way.</li>
	<li>For example, plant height depends on the amount of growth hormone released by protein. If the protein is efficient, moregrowth hormone will be released and the plant will be taller.But if the protein is inefficient, the plant will be shorter. Thusgenes control the traits.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Mechanism of Inheritance</strong>
<ul>
	<li>If both parents help to determine the trail in the progeny, both parents must be contributing a copy of the same gene.</li>
	<li>Thus, each pea plant must have two sets of all genes, one inherited from each parent, so each germ cell must have only one gene set.</li>
	<li>Each gene set is present , not as a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces each called chromosome and each cell will have two copies of each chromosome one each frommale and female parents.</li>
	<li>When two germ cells combine, they will restore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring the stability of DNAspecies.</li>
	<li>Therefore, such mechanism of inheritance explains the-results of Mendel's experiments and isused by all sexually and asexually reproducing organisms.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Chromosomes</strong> are long thread like structures present in the nucleus of a cell which contain hereditary information of the cell.

<strong>Gene </strong>is the unit of inheritance. It is therefore, a unit of specific biological function. Gene is the part of a chromosome which controls the appearance of a set of hereditary characteristics.

<strong>Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)</strong> is a chemical in the chromosome which carries the hereditary characters or traits in a coded form from one generation to the next in all the organism.

<strong>Sex Determination</strong>

Different species use different strategies for sex determination.
<ul>
	<li>In some animals, environmental factors, the temperature at which fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the animals developing in the eggs will be male or female.</li>
	<li>In other animals such as snails, individuals can change sex, indicating that sex is not genetically determined. In human beings, the sex of the individual is genetically, determined.</li>
	<li>Sex determination is the process by which sex of a new born individual can be determined.</li>
	<li>Human beings have 22 paired chromosomes and one pair called sex chromosome which is not a perfect pair.</li>
	<li>A male has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, i.e., half of the male gametes or sperms will have X chromosome and the other half will have Y chromosome.</li>
	<li>A female has two X chromosomes, i.e., all the female gametes or ova will have only X chromosomes.</li>
<ol type="(i)">
	<li>If a sperm carrying X chromosome fertilises an ovum which carries X chromosome, then the child born will be a girl.</li>
	<li>If a sperm carrying Y chromosome fertilises an ovum which carries X chromosome, then the child born will be a boy.</li>
</ol>
	<li>Thus, the sperm determines the sex of the child.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Evolution
</strong>It is the sequence of gradual changes which take place in the primitive organisms over millions of years and new species are produced. Since the evolution is of the living organisms, so it is called 'Organic Evolution'.

<strong>Variation in Population (Example)
</strong>12 red beetles live in a green leafy bush by sexual reproduction and generate variation.
<blockquote><strong>Situation-I</strong></blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Crows eat these beetles, leaving only fewer beetles available for reproduction.</li>
	<li>Due to colour variation during reproduction, only one green beetle evolves and therefore, all its progeny beetles become green.</li>
	<li>Crows cannot see green coloured beetles on green leaves and hence cannot eat them, resulting more green beetles than red ones in the beetle population.</li>
	<li>This type of variation gives a survival advantage.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><strong>Situation-II</strong></blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Due to colour variation during reproduction, a blue colour beetle appears and all its progeny beetles become blue.</li>
	<li>Crows can see both red and blue beetles and therefore, eat them.</li>
	<li>Initially there are less number of blue beetles and more of red beetles.</li>
	<li>Then an elephant stumps on the bushes and kills most of the beetles. By chance,few beetles that survived were mostly blue.</li>
	<li>Thus, the blue beetle population slowly expands.</li>
	<li>There is no survival advantage on this variation and provides diversity without adaptation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><strong>Situation-III</strong></blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>As the beetle population begins to expand, the bushes suffer from a disease and amount of leaf available for beetles have reduced.</li>
	<li>Thus, the beetles are poorly nourished and the average weight of an adult beetle has decreased.</li>
	<li>After few years, the plant disease is eliminated and enough food is available for the beetles. Thus, the beetles have come back to its normal size and weight.</li>
	<li>This change is not inherited over generation.</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Acquired Trait</strong></div>
<div>It is a particular characteristics that is developed during the lifetime of an individual. Such characteristics are not genetically controlled and cannot be passed on to next generation.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Charles Robot Darwin</strong></div>
<div>He was a British naturalists who formulated his hypothesis that evolution took place due to natural selection. Darwin's theory of evolution tells us how life evolved from simple to more complex forms.</div>
<div><strong>Origin of life on Earth</strong></div>
<div>J.B.S. Haldane, a British scientist suggested in 1929 that life must have developed from simple inorganic molecules which were present on the earth to more complex organic molecules. Thus, the first primitive organism would arise form further chemical synthesis.</div>
<div><strong>Speciation</strong></div>
<div>It is the evolution of the reproductive isolation among once-interbreeding populations, i.e., the development of one or more species from existing species.</div>
<div><strong>Micro-evolution</strong></div>
<div>It is the evolution on the relatively small scale, involving the emergence of new species or of new group below the species level, such as races and the subspecies which are significant. They also change the common characteristics of a particular species.</div>
<div><strong>Gene-Flow</strong></div>
<div>It is the exchange of genetic material by interbreeding between the populations of the same species or between the individuals within the population. Gene flow increase the variation in the genetic composition of a population.</div>
<div><strong>Genetic Drift</strong></div>
<div>It is the random change in the frequency of alleles in a population over successive generations due to sampling error in the gametes.</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Each new generation differ from its parental generation with regard to allele frequencies simply because of random variation in the distribution of gametes.</li>
	<li>This process is more rapid in smaller population, hence genetic drift can cause loss of genetic diversity if there are no genetic counteracting factors.</li>
	<li>Over generations to come genetic drift will accumulate different changes in sub-population.</li>
</ul>

<strong>1. If a trait an exits in 10% of a population of an asexually reproducing species and trait B exist in 60% of the same population, which trait is likely to have arisen earlier?</strong>Ans. Trait B is likely to have arisen earlier as in asexual reproduction traits are passed on directly from one generation to other with hardly any variation.

<strong>2. How does the creation of variation in a species promote survival?</strong>

Ans. Sometimes for a species, the environmental conditions changes drastically making their survival difficult. For example, if the temperature of habitat increases suddenly, most of the bacteria living in it would die. However, a few heat resistant’s would survive and, thus help in the survive of the species.

However, variations are not so beneficial for individual organisms.

<strong>3. How do Mendel’s experiment’s show that traits may be dominant or recessive?</strong>

Ans. Mendel selected true breeding tall and dwarf (tt) pea plants. The seeds formed after cross pollination between these plants that represented the f<sub>1</sub> generation on self-pollination the f<sub>1 </sub>plants the f<sub>2</sub> generation was obtain in which one – fourth of the plant were short

From this it can be concluded that the f<sub>1</sub> tall plants carry traits of being both tall and short, but appear tall as the tall trait is dominant over the short trait.

<strong>4. How do Mendel’s experiments show that traits are inherited independently?</strong>

Ans. Mendel crossed pea plants having round green seeds (RRyy) with those having wrinkled yellow seeds (rrYY). The seed so formed of the f<sub>1 </sub>generation were yellow wrinkled. Although they had both the characters in them, the yellow round traits are dominant, so the f1 plants have round yellow seeds.

On self-pollinating the f1 progeny, the f2 progeny was found to have yellow round seeds, green round seeds, yellow wrinkled seeds and green wrinkled seed in the ratio 9:3:3:1.

This reveals that the traits are inherited independently and not in groups.

<strong>5. A man with blood group A marries women with blood group O and their daughter has blood group O. Is this information enough to tell which of the traits-blood group A or O is dominant? Why or Why not?</strong>

Ans. No, this information is not sufficient to determine which trait is dominant. This is because we do not know about the blood group of all the progeny.

<strong>6. How is the sex of the child determined in human being?</strong>

Ans. In humans, females have a XX sex chromosome, whereas the males have a XY Sex chromosome while fertilization, the female gamete provides on X chromosome while the male gamete provides either X or Y that determines whether the baby will be a male or female.

<strong>7. What are the different ways in which individuals with a particular trait may increase in the population?</strong>

Ans. Individuals with a particular trait may increase in the population due to:
<ol>
	<li>Natural selection, when the trait offers some survival advantage.</li>
	<li>Genetic drift; when some genes governing that trait become common in the population.</li>
	<li>Acquired traits; when that trait gets acquired during the individual lifetime.</li>
</ol>
<strong>8. Why are traits acquired during the life time of an individual not inherited?</strong>

Ans. This is because an acquired trait does not involve change in the genes or the reproductive tissues which cannot be passed on to the germ cells of the progeny. Therefore, these traits are not inherited.

<strong>9. Why are small numbers of surviving tigers a cause of worry from the point of view of genetics?</strong>

Ans. Small numbers of tigers mean that fewer genetic variations are available. This means that on reproducing, tigers have a lesser chance of producing progeny with variations that may prove useful. This is a cause of worry from the point of view of genetics.

<strong>10. What factors could lead to the rise of new species?</strong>

Ans. Natural selection, genetic drift and acquisition of traits during the lifetime of an individual can give rise to new species.

<strong>11. Will geographic isolation be a major factor in the speciation of a self-pollination species?</strong>

Ans. No, as the plant are self-pollination, i.e., the pollen is transferred from the anther to the stigma of the some flower or flower of the some plant, geographical isolation cannot prevent speciation in this case.

<strong>12. Give an example of characteristics being used to determine how close two species are in evolutionary terms?</strong>

Ans. The presence of feathers in dinosaurs and birds indicates that they are evolutionarily related. For dinosaurs, feathers provided insulation. However, they came to be used for flight by birds. This proves the reptiles and birds are closely related and that the evolution of wings started in reptiles.

<strong>13. Can the wings of butterfly and the wings of a bat be considered homologous organs? Why or why not?</strong>

Ans. The wings of butterfly are similar to these of a bat in terms of function as both serve the purpose of flying. However, they are not similar in structure. Therefore, they are analogous organs, not homologous.

<strong>14. What are fossils? What do they tells us about the process of evolution?</strong>

Ans. Fossils are the imprinted remains of prehistoric organisms. They represent the ancestors of the organisms we see today. They provide evolutionary evidence by revealing changes that have occurred during the passage of time to give rise to the prevent breed of organisms.

<strong>15. Why are human beings who look so different from each other in terms of size, colour and looks said to belong to the same species?</strong>

Ans. Skin colour, looks, size, etc are all variety of features present due in environmental variation. There is no biological bias to the concept of races. Therefore, all humans are of a single species as humans of different colour, size and looks are capable of reproducing to produce a healthy offspring.

<strong>16. In evolutionary terms, can we say which among bacteria, spiders, fish and chimpanzees have a better body design? Why or why not?</strong>

Ans. No. we cannot say that a particular organism has a better body design as complexity in body design due to evolution cannot always be equated with progress or betterment. Sometimes, simple body designs are better than complex ones. For example, bacteria can survive in a variety of extreme condition due to their simple body design.

<strong>17. A study found that children with light coloured eyes are likely to have parents with light coloured eyes. On this basis can we say anything about whether the light eye colour is dominant or the light eye colour is dominant or recessive? Why or why not?</strong>

Ans. No, it cannot be said whether light eye colour I dominant or recessive. Let us assume that the children have either LL or Ll or ll genotype. If they have LL genotype, the their parents too will have LL genotype.

If the children have ll genotype, them the parents will have ll genotype.

<strong>18. How are the areas of study evolution and classification interlinked?</strong>

Ans. Classification involves grouping of organisms into a formal system based on similarities in body structure on evolutionary history. Two species, with more recent ancestor are likely to be grouped together.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[introduction text="

A 'Shady Plot' by Elsie Brown is a ghost story. Unlike the other ghost stories which are quite scary and gruesome, this story is humorous. Humour arises out of the narrator's ability to laugh at himself and his situation. It is quite amusing to note that a ghost shakes the confidence of the narrator in his writing abilities.

"]

[story text="

John, The narrator, wrote ghost stories because they were in the demand. For earning his living, he served as an accountant in a company. Once he was asked by his publisher Jenkins to write a ghost story. The narrator reluctantly agreed to do so. When he was all alone on his room, he started thinking of the plot of his story. He remained blank for some time. The moment he said, 'This writing business is delightful, isn't it ?', he was shocked to hear a voice, 'Yes... I should say it is !' Soon a ghost appeared in parts. The ghost named Helen told him how she had been assisting him with ideas about his stories in the past. She said that she and her co-ghost were now on strike. So she would not help him until he persuaded all his friends and acquaintances to stop using the Ouija board being used to call them (ghosts and spirits). The ghost disappeared when the narrator's wife appeared.

The narrator's wife, Lavinia, and her friends were interested in Ouija board games. Once they organised such a game to call on the spirits. Lavinia forced her husband to join. When the ladies started using the board, the board behaved strangely. It spelt 'traitor' and then 'Helen'. The ladies came to know that someone by the name Helen wanted to communicate with John. Lavinia was shocked. After The ladies had departed,  she informed her husband that she was going back to her grandmother and would take divorce. John felt shattered and helpless. Gladiola, the African maid, also wanted to leave as she was afraid of magic and hoodoo. In order to stop her from going, Lavania asked her to burn her Ouija board. After she had said so, the ghost of Helen again appeared. John did not want his wife to see the ghost lest she should swoon. However, Lavinia did see the ghost and talked to her. She remained calm and composed. She realized her folly. After the ghost had departed, the narrator felt a sudden strong desire to write. He had got an excellent plot for a story.

"]

[character text="

<strong>John Hallock:</strong>

John Hallock is quite imaginative and creative and writes popular ghost stories. He is loving and caring husband. He tries to fulfil all the desires of his wife. He dose not mind his wife's fads and spendthrift nature. He is not afraid of ghosts. That is why, he confronts the ghost of Helen and even indulges in banter with her. He is shy by nature and reluctantly touches the fingers of a young lady, his partner at the Ouija board game.

<strong>Lavinia Hallock:</strong>

Lavinia Hallock, the narrator's wife, loves novelty and thrills. She has formed her Book Club. She is fond of using Ouija board to communicate with the spirits. She is quite spendthrift. She spends a lot of money on grocery and fancy shopping. she is suspicious and jealous. She thinks that her husband was flirtatious and was having an affair. So she decides to divorce him. But she soon realizes her mistake. She is not as weak-willed as her husband thinks her to be.

"]

[theme text="

The story 'A Shady Plot' is a ghost story. Unlike other ghost stories which are frightening, this story is humorous. It brings home the idea that some ghosts, if the have real existence, are good and benevolent by nature. Human beings tend to communicate with the spirits and ghosts, which is abnormal and undesirable. We should let the spirits of the other world undisturbed. Calling on them through dubious means may prove to be harmful.

"]

[title text="

The title of the story is quite adaptive and suggestive. The word 'shady' refers to something dubious, whereas 'plot' refers to secret plan. The shady plot, thus, refers to dubious and questionable existence of ghost of Helen that appears in the story in a quite funny way. The ghost comes to disturb the placid life of the narrator and his wife, but luckily fails to do so.

"]

[saq text="

<strong>1. Why was the writer getting over confident about his ability of writing ghost stories?</strong>

Ans : Mr Hallock, the writer had always managed to write good ghost stories, though he was not a specialist in these kind of stories. Such stories were greatly in public demand. He was confident that somehow or the other, a good plot always appeared from somewhere and he was able to write a good story.

<strong>2. Watching the ghost taking shape was ‘Like watching of the moving picture cartoons put together,’ how?</strong>

Ans : Helen, the ghost, appeared in parts. First, a hand took shape, then some other body part, so on and so forth. The process in which the final apparition appeared in the end, was a matter of surprise. The ghost always took shape in bits and pieces like a cartoon in a moving picture.

<strong>3. What surprising revelation is made by the ghost? Why did the writer not believe her?</strong>

Ans : The writer was greatly surprised to discover that all the good plots of ghost stories had been supplied to him by the ghost Helen. The writer disbelieved her because he had never really seen her before. But the ghost said that she had sat on his shoulders and suggested the plots for his stories.

<strong>4. Why is the ghost fed up of the Ouija Board fanatics?</strong>

Ans : The ghosts are now fed up of being called again and again for answers and queries. They were pulled out of beds at odd times, so they were very tired. The Ouija Board crazy fans would keep asking questions, so this irritated the ghosts and proved to be tiresome and troublesome.

<strong>5. What reasons are given by Lavinia for not getting rid of the Ouija Board?</strong>

Ans : Lavinia felt that the Ouija board was procured at bargain price. Moreover she felt that it would help her husband in writing ghost stories. It would also provide an interesting activity for her book-club meetings.

<strong>6. Why was the narrator shocked to see the activities of his wife’s Book Club?</strong>

Ans : The narrator was in for a great shock to see that all the ladies of his wife’s book-club were sitting near a Ouija Board. Helen, the ghost, had threatened the narrator that he must exert all his force to dissuade people from using the Ouija Board and keep calling ghosts now and then for their problems. So to see so many ladies using the board was a painful sight for him.

<strong>7. What controversy or furore was caused in the parlour by the name of ‘Helen’?</strong>

Ans : The narrator was forced to be a partner in the Ouija board game and to his horror he discovered that he was called a ‘traitor’ by the ghost. When Miss Hinkle wished to know the details, it was revealed on the Ouija Board that the person, who had called the narrator, a traitor, was someone with the name ‘Helen’ This name created controversy since the narrator’s wife did not know anyone with that name.

<strong>8. Helen the ghost says, ‘‘ I’m too tired to materialise’’. What does she imply by the above statement?</strong>

Ans : Helen was too tired because she had to work overtime the earlier night answering all the questions of Lavinia’s friends. She took longer than before to appear in her full shape because she couldn't be expected to retain all her faculties after answering all the Ouija Board fanatics of Lavinia’s book-club, all the night.

<strong>9. Why did Helen pay a visit to the narrator again?</strong>

Ans : Helen paid a visit to the narrator because she had been sent to ensure that the narrator’s wife should get rid of the Ouija Board. She had come to threaten the writer and if he did not pay any heed then she would not help the narrator to suggest new plots for his stories.

<strong>10. Lavinia entered the narrator’s room with a solid finality. What was her purpose?</strong>

Ans : Lavinia had become suspicious of the narrator that he was involved with some woman called ‘Helen’. So she had come to tell her husband that she was leaving him and moving out. She could not tolerate the infidelity of her husband.

<strong>11. Why was the narrator unable to conceal Helen behind his back before his wife?</strong>

Ans : Lavinia refused to stand on one side, so she jumped quickly to see who was standing behind her husband. She was already suspicious and noticed that her husband was trying to conceal someone behind his back. Even Helen did not disappear so both the women confronted each other first time.

<strong>12. How did Lavinia react after facing Helen?</strong>

Ans : The writer had always thought that Lavinia was weak-hearted and she might faint at the sight of the ghost. But nothing like this happened. The interaction proved positive and Lavinia stood boldly and confidently before the ghost.

<strong>13. Why did the narrator have a strong urge to pen down his new story?</strong>

Ans : The narrator had undergone a great experience. It was scary, interesting, revealing and an excellent plot for any ghost story. A ghost story based on this kind of story was going to be a sure hit.

<strong>14. What did Jenkins do to earn his living ?</strong>

Ans: Jenkins was a writer, bur even then he had to serve as a accountant in an office to earn his living. He had not reached the point of being a whole time writer.

<strong>15. Who was Helen ? Why did she came before the narrator ?</strong>

Ans: Helen was a female ghost. She appeared before the narrator when he was about to write a ghost story. He was witout any idea about the plot of his story. When he was talking to himself, Helen appeared slowly in parts.

<strong>16. Why had the ghost appeared ?</strong>

Ans: The ghost Helen had appeared to tell the narrator that she and her co-ghosts helping writers like him were n strike. The ghosts were fed up with too many calls of assistance from human beings.

<strong>17. Who was Lavinia ? What made her decide to leave her husband ?</strong>

Ans: Lavinia was the narrator's wife. She thought that her husband had an affair with the lady called Helen. So she decided to leave her husband and even to divorce him.

<strong>18. Why did Lavinia change her mind to leave her husband?</strong>

Ans: Lavinia changed her mind to leave hr husband after having seen the ghost of Helen herself. She realized her mistake. She learnt that Helen was not a living human being but a ghost who once lived in New York.

<strong>19. When did the writer come to have the idea of an excellent plot of a ghost story ?</strong>

Ans: The writer can=me to have an idea of an excellent plot of a ghost story after his wife had decided to burn her Ouija board. The ghost of Helen was satisfied. She might have assisted the narrator with the idea of his new story now.

<strong>20. Who is Gladolia ? Why did she wish to leave the narrator's house ? What made her give up the idea ?</strong>

Ans: Gladolia was an African maid in the narrator's house. She wished to leave the narrator's house because she was afraid of magic and hoodo. She gave up the idea when the narrator's wife agreed to burn her magical Ouija board.

<strong>1. John had become a nervous wreck. It had been a hard journey back to normalcy and marital bliss. He writes a diary entry expressing these feelings. Write this for him.</strong>

Ans: Dear Diary,

What a harrowing and emotional nightmare I have gone through! On God! These days will always remain permanently etched in my memory. Imagine a ghost helping you with the stories and thus causing your marriage to break. How I was saved at the last minute, is a marvel? Those days when Helen had threatened me and then Lavinia refused to give up the Ouija board; I was blamed for infidelity, I could neither sleep nor walk out. I wish I had confided in my wife before. Thank God! Everything is normal as before. But this traumatic period of time, I will never forget. All is well that ends well.

John Hallock.

<strong>2. John’s new ghost story is a hit and proves to be a best seller. Jenkins throws a party in his honour and John is asked to give a speech regarding the success of his work and the inspiration behind it. Prepare the speech of him.</strong>

Ans: Dear friends,

I am deeply obliged for your best wishes and support for my success. Believe me friends, I am not an expert in ghost stories but somehow a good plot occurs out of the blue and becomes the solid ground of my stories. I know, you find my stories very fascinating and thrilling as most ghost stories are. Well, stories can only work if there is someone to inspire or guide you. Even I have an angel sitting on my shoulders to steer the course of my stories. I hope it continues this way.

Thanks.

<strong>3. Helen, the ghost had close encounters with human beings like John. She goes back to her world and mulls over this experience she had on earth. She writes a diary entry regarding the behaviour of human beings and the fickleness of their relationships. Write this diary entry for her.</strong>

Ans: Dear Diary,

This was my first opportunity to have close encounters with human beings for a long stretch of time. Basically we stay out of bounds but now I was forced to materialise in person and threaten John, as there was no other option. I know John is basically a good guy, vulnerable and kind but his wife is too dominating. He is so scared of her and she started doubting her husband at the mention of a mere word ‘Helen’. John was trying to hide me, not to distress her but, look how she behaved. These human beings have fickle relationships, despite all. I think we are better off for we keep our relationships intact Helen.

<strong>4. Do you believe ‘A Shady Plot’ qualifies as a good ghost story?</strong>

Ans: Yes, this is a very good story with the most interesting storyline and plot. The plot has been inspired from a real life experience which makes it authentic. It has suspense, it is scary with ghosts walking in and out, but the best part is the humour. The story is not the stereotype one, it is funny and hilarious. It is very interesting to know that even ghosts get fed up of haunting and they are dragged out of their beds at all hours. This story is full of surprises and that is the best quality of a ghost story.

<center><strong>Short</strong></center><strong>1. What genre of stories does Jenkins want the narrator to write ? Why ?</strong>

Ans: Jenkins wants the narrator to write supernatural or ghost stories. The public wants to read real 'horror' stuff. It is the public demand which compels him to ask the narrator to write another ghost story.

<strong>2. Does the narrator like writing ghost stories ? Support your answer with evidence from the story.</strong>

Ans: The narrator doesn't like writing the ghost stories. Even then he has to write them because he cannot say 'no' to his first publisher Jekins and also because he needs money to satisfy the endless demands of his wife.

<strong>3. What makes Helen, the ghost, and her co-ghosts organise the Writer's Inspiration Bureau ?</strong>

Ans: Helen and her co-ghosts organise the Writer's Inspiration Bureau to help those writers who wish to write stroies find themselves without ideas and whose minds are quite soft to accept impression.

<strong>4. Why had Helen, the ghost, been helping the narrator write ghost stories ? Why was she gong on strike ? What conditions did she place for providing continued help ?</strong>

Ans: Helen, the ghost had been helping the narrator write ghost stories as she worked for the Writer's Inspiration Bureau and had been a writer when she was alive. She and he co-ghosts were going on strike because they were fed up of being called out of their beds too often from the people for assistance, particularly from the users of Ouija board. She said the narrator would have to help to persuade people not to use Ouija board if he needed her help any more.

<strong>5. How does the ghost undermine the narrator’s faith in his ability to write ghost stories?</strong>

Ans: The ghost undermines the narrator's faith in his ability to write the ghost stories by telling him how she has been helping him with all those ideas about his stories. Without her help he would not have written his stories.

<strong>6. Why does John want the ghost to disappear before his wife appears on the scene? What impression of his wife’s character do you form from his words?</strong>

Ans: John doesn't want his wife to see the ghost least she should become hysterical and faint. He thinks his wife weak-willed.

<strong>7. Why does the narrator hesitate to be a partner to Laura Hinkle during Ouija Board party?</strong>

Ans: The narrator hesitates to be the partner to Laura Hinkle because he is quite shy and doesn't want to be touched by Laura in any way. Perhaps he is also hesitant in the presence of his wife. Also, he fears the ghost- Helen- who, if sees him now using an Ouija Board, might do something to him.

<strong>8. What message does the ghost convey to the group that had assembled in the narrator’s house? What is their reaction to the message?</strong>

Ans: The ghost story conveys the message that it is not good and desirable to call the ghosts unnecessarily. The group at the Ouija board Party seems to have understood the message. That is why, the narrator's wife asks her maid to use the Ouija board for kindling wood.

<strong>9. Do you agree with narrator calling the assembly of women ‘manipulators’. Give reasons.</strong>

Ans: The narrator calls the assembly of women 'manipulators' as he does not believe that someone can call his name through their Ouija boards as Helen was interacting through his board. The women, he believes, are only trying to create trouble for him.

<strong>10. Why is John’s wife angry? What does she decide to do?</strong>

Ans: John's wife is angry as she comes to believe that he is having an affair with a women called Helen. She decides to go back to her grandmother and divorce her husband.

<strong>11. Why does John wish he were dead?</strong>

Ans: John wishes he were dead on learning that his wife is going back to her grandmother and intends to divorce him. He was unable to bear the very idea of it.

<strong>12. When confronted by Lavinia about his flirtations over the Ouija Board, John insists that 'The affair was quite over-board, I assure you', Bring out the pun in this statement.</strong>

Ans: A pun is a play on a words for two disparate meanings. In John's statement the pun is involved in the word 'over-board'. It means what happened between the John and Laura Hinkle- The touching of fingers- was over the Ouija board. It also means that there is nothing secretive about anything. He is open and honest in the matter.

<strong>13. John’s apprehensions about his wife’s reaction to her encounter with the ghost are unfounded. Justify.</strong>

Ans: When John's wife finally encountered the ghost she did not become hysterical and swoon, as was earlier apprehended by the him. She proved to be quite brave and strong.

<center><strong>Long</strong></center><strong>1. After her reconciliation with her husband, John Hallock, Lavinia writes a letter to her friend expressing how her relationship with him had almost been on the verge of breaking and what saved it. Write her letter.</strong>

Ans:
Post Street
10 September,
20 xx Dear Anne,

I am extremely sorry for not responding earlier. My life had taken a strong turn and I was left grappling with some apprehensions. Believe me, you were uppermost in my mind but I wanted to sort out my domestic problems and then write to you with a clear frame of mind.
Last month I underwent a very bad phase of my life. You know how proud I am of John and his creative abilities. I have always appreciated his skill in churning out excellent stories along with being a considerate husband. He has always supported me in my endeavors, but sometimes even honesty is also put to test. Once during the Book Club game with my friends, the Ouija board hinted that John was having an affair with someone called Helen. I was dumb founded and I threatened to quit. You know, I am impatient I can never tolerate infidelity. I had packed my suitcase and was on the verge of deserting John, when I discovered to my surprise, it was an apparition, a ghost, named Helen who was haunting him. Who would believe that ghosts are found in today’s world? Nevertheless I’m happy that I discovered the truth eventually. Now all is well and there is no reason to worry. However, I blame myself for all this ruckus. I never gave him chance to explain, nor did I show faith in him. I should have remained unflinching in my trust. So the famous quote proved true in my case ‘‘Jealousy, thy name is woman’’. I have learnt my lesson now.
Please write to me about yourself also.
Your friend
Lavinia.

<strong>2. Discuss the significance of the title of the lesson, ‘‘A Shady Plot’’.</strong>

Ans: The title ‘A Shady Plot’ is most appropriate because most of the situations and characters remain unclear and foggy. At first instance the writer is plagued by doubts regarding the plot of the story. He tries really hard and it appears he is chasing the shadows in search of a ghost story. The appearance of the ghost is open to interpretation. Is it there, is it not there. There is doubt regarding the existence of Helen, she is spooky and gives rise to apprehensions. The existence of Helen is questionable, no one else will believe it, it is beyond the realm of reality. Moreover, doubts are cast over John’s character, his honesty is questioned, his relationship with Helen is hidden, concealed and he alone knows it. The appearance of Helen upsets John’s life. His wife and cook threaten to quit and shadows of divorce looms large over his relationship with his wife. The plot for a new story remained ‘‘unclear’’ for a long time. It is only in the end, that John can visualise an excellent plot in its perfection. Moreover, the ghost and apparitions are always believed to remain concealed, relegated to shady and dark areas. The appearance of Helen from darkness and retreat to darkness highlights the relevance of the title.

<div id="summary" class="accordion-body collapse">
<strong>Need and Why?</strong>
<ol type="i">
	<li>Helps study chemistry of elements systematically.</li>
	<li>Need not remember the properties of all elements seperately but only those of groups and periods.</li>
	<li>Helps understand the gradual change of properties.</li>
	<li>Helps understand relationship between different classes of elements.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Early classifications:-</strong>
<ul>
	<li>On basis on Metals or Non Metals:-</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shortcomings-</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>too general,</li>
	<li>could not explain the metallic properties of some non metals.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>On Basis of Valency:-</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shortcomings:-</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>could not explain the variable valency of single element.</li>
	<li>Elements with same valency have different properties.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<strong>Dobereiner's Triads (By J. Dobereiner):-</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Proposed in 1817.</li>
	<li>3 elements were grouped together according to their atomic mass. The atomic mass of the middle element is approximately equal to the average of the masses of the extreme elements of the groups.</li>
	<li>There is gradation in properties of elements of these triads. eg:-</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>Li &lt; Na &lt; K : in respect of displacing H from H<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
	<li>Cl &gt; Br &gt; I : in respect of displacing each other from their compounds.</li>
	<li>Ca &lt; Sr &lt; Ba : in respect of displacing H from H<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Thus, the middle element of a triad has an intermediate atomic mass and is properties lie between those elements.</li>
	<li>Shortcomings:- All elements cannot be classified.</li>
	<li>Property Explored:- Relation between atomic mass and properties of elements.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Newland's Law of Octaves (By John Newland):-</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Proposed in 1866.</li>
	<li>Newland's Law of Octaves:- When elements are arranged in the order of their increasing atomic masses, the properties of every eighth element is a repetition of the first one.</li>
	<li>Shortcomings:-</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>Was applicable only till Calcium as after that every 8th element was not similar to the first one.</li>
	<li>Several elements were discovered that did not fit into the Newland's Law of Octaves.</li>
	<li>To fit elements in the table two elements (Co &amp; Ni)were put in 1 slot in a column of unlike elements(Cl, F, Br and I).</li>
	<li>Iron (Fe) which resembles Co and Ni in properties, was placed far from them.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Dobereiner's triads also exist in Newland's Classification of elements.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Mendeleev's Periodic Table (The Original Periodic Table):-</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Mendeleev's Periodic Law:- Proposed in 1869, this law states that properties of elements are dependent on their atomic mass and this dependence is periodic.</li>
	<li>Periodic Table:- Devised in 1869, it was arranged in order of increasing atomic mass. Some places were left for unknown elements, eg.- Scandium; Noble gases later added as a separate column at the end of 19th Century.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Main Features:-</li>
<ol type="a">
	<li><strong>Groups and Subgroups </strong>are the columns in the periodic table represented by Roman Numeral I-VIII.</li>
	<li>Each group is <strong>divided in two subgroups</strong>, A &amp; B which are single columned.</li>
	<li><strong>Group VIII B contains 3 sets</strong> of elements each: Fe, Co, Ni.</li>
	<li><strong>Group VIII A has Noble gases</strong>.</li>
	<li>Elements in any subgroup resemble each other.</li>
	<li>Elements of <strong>Subgroup A don't resemble those in Subgroup B</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Periods</strong> are the rows which comprise of the entire range of elements after which properties repeat. Represented by Arabic numerals 1-7.</li>
</ol>
	<li>Usefulness:-</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Valency</strong>:- Elements in a group have the same valency, that changes gradually in a period.</li>
<ul>
	<li>In respect to H -&gt; Rises from 1 to 4 and then falls 4 to 1 gradually moving from left to right.</li>
	<li>In respect to O -&gt; Maximum valency is the same as the group number.</li>
</ul>
	<li>Correction of atomic mass:- Atomic mass of an element is found out by formula: atomic mass = equivalent mass x valency.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[introduction text="

Satyajit Ray, one of the grand masters of the world cinema, was a good story writer. Most of his stories were meant for teenagers. In 'Patol Babu, Film Star', he underlines the idea that no role in a film is minor or insignificant. The actor must do his job with perfection and dedication just as Patol Babu does while enacting the role of a pedestrian.

"]

[story text="

Patol Babu was recommended by his neighbor, Nishikanto Ghosh, for a role in a film. It was a pleasant surprise for him. He was already 52-year-nonentity. Years ago he was a theatre actor and was quite popular. But that was a thing of a remote past. As he was without work, he needed money badly. so he accepted the role, though it was not very significant. He was, of course, quite hopeful and excited, though his wife was not. On the set, He wanted to know his lines which he was supposed to speak. On his persistence he was handed over a slip of paper.On it was written just one word 'oh!'. He was told that he was to act as an absent-minded pedestrian who would utter 'oh!'. When he would collide with an actor walking in a hurry on the pavement.

Patol Babu was disappointed. At one time he decided to leave. Then suddenly he was reminded the words of his mentor, Mr. Pakrashi, who used to say that no actor should reject a part thinking it beneath his dignity to do so. 'Each word in a play is like a fruit in a tree.' Mr. Pakrashi once remarked. So Patol Babu went to a secluded place and rehearsed saying 'oh' in many ways and discovered several possibilities. The shot was ready. The director gave Patol Babu a moustache, which suited him well. On Patol Babu's own suggestion he was handed over a newspaper, which he would pretend to be reading while walking on a pavement. Patol Babu was able to do his role with perfection. Everybody seemed to be satisfied. Patol Babu felt deep satisfaction. He did not wait for payment and left for home. The meagre payment which he was to receive seemed to be nothing before the intense satisfaction he had to got while doing his job. He needed money, but he did not bother. He was truly a 'strange follow'.

"]

[character text="

<strong>Patol Babu:</strong>

Patol Babu, the protagonist, is a 52-year-old bald man. He is diligent, sincere and hard working. Once he was a popular theatre actor. He is talented and imaginative. He enacts his minor role in a film with perfection. He needs money badly as he is out of work, and yet is not money-minded. Without getting his payment for his role,he comes back with the feeling that he has done his job perfectly well. He is modest as well as humble.

<strong>Baren Mullick:</strong>

Baren Mullick is director of three hit films. He seems to be quite meticulous and hard working. He has an uncanny ability to judge somebody and something quickly and accurately. Patol Babu appreciates his giving him a moustache which suits him very well. Mullick is quite receptive. He agrees to Babu's suggestion of having a newspaper to pretend reading it in the scene. He knows his job well.

"]

[theme text="

The theme of the story is that money is nothing in comparison with the inner satisfaction one gets from a job well done. This is what Patol Babu reveals at the end. Though he was in need of money, he leaves home without getting the payment for his role. He is satisfied that he has done his job well. Moreover, the story brings home the idea that no role or the dialogue in a film or the stage is insignificant. A good actor can leave indelible impression doing a minor role or even uttering no word.

"]

[title text="

The title of the story is quite adaptive. It is justified as the whole story is about the protagonist Patol Babu. It begins with and ends on his story as a film actor. No other character is important as he is. The story brings about all the essential traits of his personality.

<strong>15. What details of the role were furnished by Naresh Dutt, the film’s director, to Patol Babu?</strong>

Ans :   Patol Babu was supposed to enact the role of a pedestrian  who  is  absent-minded  and  short-tempered. There were some dialogues also according to Naresh Dutt and it was supposed to be a proper speaking part.

<strong>16. Describe the scene outside the Faraday House briefly.</strong>

Ans :  A big crowd had already gathered outside the building. A bus was carrying the equipment, There were cameras, stands, crowds of people everywhere. Most of the people were busy carrying the equipment, carting it here and there.

<strong>17. Why was Patol Babu particular about getting his dialogues in advance?</strong>

Ans :  Patol Babu was a perfectionist. He wished to practice his dialogues beforehand so that he does not make a spectacle of himself infront of the lead actors. He was too enthusiastic and didn’t wish to make any mistake in his performance.

<strong>18. 'Patol Babu glanced at the paper... and found a sudden throbbing in his head. The heat was unbearable.' Why did this happen?</strong>

Ans :   Patol Babu  found that he had to speak just one word, that too a monosyllable ‘Oh!’ He had been promised a proper speaking part and after a long wait and great expectation, he felt too depressed to see his small role. He felt cheated and quite demoralised.

<strong>19. What kind of practice did Patol Babu do?</strong>

Ans :   Patol Babu  practiced speaking  ‘Oh!’ a  thousand times.  He tried  to  give it  a  different  inflection,  add  all kinds of emotions and styles to this word. He practiced his body language, how he would act during collision with the hero, how he would fling his arms, how his body would crouch in pain and surprise.

<strong>20. What justification is rendered by Sasanko regarding Patol Babu’s speaking role?</strong>

Ans :   Sasanko was a very clever and tactful person. He told Patol Babu that he had a regular speaking part and he was indeed very lucky to get such a part in Baren Mullick’s film. Most of the people had only crowd scenes and even the lead actor had no lines to speak that day.

<strong>21. Why did Patol Babu disappear before collecting his payment?</strong>

Ans :   Patol Babu was happy at his performance because he felt that he had done his best. But he was crestfallen at the indifferent behaviour of the film people. So he felt that no money could compensate for his great efforts and the hard work he had put in. He had been simply exhausted after the long wait and hard work he had put in. Now the reward of twenty rupees looked too meagre and insufficient.

<strong>1. Patol Babu reached home and was overcome with mixed feelings of happiness for a good performance but disappointment for being sidelined with such a speaking role. He writes a diary entry in this state of mind. Write the diary for him.</strong>

Ans : Dear Diary,

It was a day of mixed emotions, happiness and disappointment packed together. I had gone to Faraday House with great expectations and imagine I was asked to utter just ‘oh’! How I died an instant death? All my hopes and aspirations were dashed to pieces. But still I kept my cool. I remembered the advice of my mentor and perfected every bit of my role. Almost everyone, even the hero Chanchal Kumar praised my good work. But the mechanical, inhuman nature of the film-folk hurt me when the time came to collect my twenty rupees, I could not remain there. No money could measure my hard-work and dedication. I know even twenty rupees are needed at home but I felt they were not a worthy remuneration. I hope I am right! God alone knows!

Patol Babu

<strong>2. Naresh Dutt, the director, was surprised to find Patol Babu missing. He had seen Patol Babu’s meticulous nature and eye for minute details. No one ever went away without taking the money. Despite his busy schedule, Naresh Dutt couldn’t forget Patol Babu. He found out the details of Patol Babu’s hard work from other people around. He writes a letter to his friend regarding the hardwork some insignificant people put in and yet their contribution goes unacknowledged. Write the letter for him.</strong>

Ans :
Service Lane,
ABC City
5 Sept. 2010
Dear Mohan,

In our busy lives we seldom notice exceptional people who look quite ordinary. I wish to recount such an incident to you when I had hired a man, who was 52 years old named Patol Babu for a minuscule role. He just had to utter one word ‘oh’! I was told later by my staff and other people that Patol Babu, after the initial disappointment, had practiced that word in all different kind of ways. He gave a superb performance but we were too busy in other technicalities and looking after lead actors to notice it. I was amazed to discover to note that he did not want to collect his money. Maybe we have erred in some way. I am sure we undermined his capability. Nevertheless I will go home personally and try to make amends and talk to him. That will really ease my guilt. Will share the rest with you later.

Your friend,
Naresh Dutt

<strong>3. Give a character sketch of Patol Babu giving evidence from the text.</strong>

Ans : Patol Babu was a modest, talented and timid man. He was an artist at heart — emotional, talented but too prone to being hurt. He was full of dramatic skills and could deliver powerful dialogues. He had been a great hit, doing theatre for ‘jatras’ and people specially flocked to see him. He was a perfectionist and packed in a very powerful performance for his minuscule role. His Oh! had modulation of voice, body language and great dramatic skills. He was most emotional and felt really hurt to see the neglect in the eyes of the director. Patol babu is an ideal artist who is not wordly wise and a dreamer who is not practical.

<center><strong>Short</strong></center><strong>1. What was the news that Nishikanto Ghosh gave Patol Babu ?</strong>

Ans: Nishikanto Ghoshtold Patol Babu that his brother-in-law was looking for an actor for a scene in a film- fiftyish, short and bald-headed. He thought that the role would suit him and so he had recommended his name to his brother-in-law.

<strong>2. How did Patol Babu react ? Why ?</strong>

Ans: Patol Babu reacted positively. He agreed to do the role for the film because he had acted on the stage about thirty years ago. He had no reason to say 'no' to such a good offer

<strong>3. Why had Patol Babu lost his first job in Calcutta ?</strong>

Ans:Patol Babu was quite happy and satisfied with his job with Hudson and Kimberley i Calcutta. He had to lose his job because of sudden retrenchment in his office due to war.

<strong>4.How does Patol Babu reconcile to the dialogue given to him ?</strong>

Ans: At first Patol Babu is not happy with the one word dialogue given to hom. Then he is reminded of the words of his stage mentor, Gogon Prakashi, that each word spoken in a play is important. He himself discovers that the word 'oh' to be spoken by him carries different shades of meaning. So he gets reconciled to his dialogue.

<strong>5. Who was Prakashi ? How do his words help Patol Babu in enacting his role ?</strong>

Ans: Mr. Prakashi was Ptol Babu's mentor when he was a stage actor. His words helped patol babu to enact his role well because he had told him that no role in play is minor of insignificant.

<strong>6. How do we know that Patol Babu was a meticulous man ?</strong>

Ans: Patol Babu was meticulous man, He rehersed speaking his one-word dialogue repeatedly. He even wanted to rehearse a small role. Then it was on his suggestion that he was given a newspaper so that the scene came off quite realistically.

<strong>7. Why did Mr Mullick turn down Patol Babu’s request for a rehearsal ?</strong>

Ans: Mr. Mullick turned down Patol Babu's request for a rehearsal because the sun could be clouded at any moment. He wanted the scene to be filmed in sunlight.

<strong>8. What were the special touches that Patol Babu gave to his role to make it more authentic ?</strong>

Ans: In order to make his role more authentic, Patol Babu took apaper in the hand topretend that he was reading it when the 'collision' took place. He uttered the word 'oh' mixing fifty parts of anguish with twenty-five of surprise and twenty-fiv of irritation.

<center><strong>Long</strong></center><strong>1. 'I hope the part calls for some dialogue?' Who says this? Why does he /she ask this question?</strong>

Ans: These lines are said by Patol Babu.  He had been a stage actor for many years before work forced him to come to Calcutta.  He was a very passionate actor; in fact he was obsessed with acting.  There was a time when people would buy tickets just to see him perform.

After many years, Patol Babu was offered a role in a film. He was both surprised and happy to receive this offer.  He enquired about his role so that he could rehearse for it. He was told that his role was that of a pedestrian. He wanted to know if the role had any dialogues because he was very keen to show off his acting prowess.

<strong>2. 'Were these people pulling his legs? Was the whole thing a gigantic hoax? </strong><strong>A meek, harmless man like him, and they had to drag him into the middle of the city to make a laughing stock out of him. How could anyone be so cruel?' Why does </strong><strong>Patol Babu have these thoughts?</strong>

Ans: The reason for Patol Babu having such kind of thoughts was that the dialogue that he was given shocked him. It was for the first time that Patol Babu has got an opportunity to act in a film. Till now he had acted on the stage. He was very excited. He reaches the shooting site at the designated time. After watching the film shoot for sometime, he asked for his dialogue so that he could memorise and rehearse it.

All he had to do was to collide with the hero and utter “oh”. He was very disappointed. He expected a small role with some dialogues but here he just had to utter a monosyllable. Patol Babu was a very good actor and he thought that by giving him such an insignificant role they had made a mockery of him and his acting skills.

<strong>3. Patol Babu is an amateur actor for whom walk-on part in a movie turns into an ultimate challenge. Discuss.</strong>

Ans: Patol Babu is initially very disappointed because of the small role he had been given.  Then he is reminded of his mentor’s words that “however small a part, never consider it beneath your dignity to accept it”.Motivated by these words, Patol Babu decides to rehearse his part before the final shoot. He chooses a reclusive spot to practice. As he practices, he realises that a monosyllabic exclamation could be said in different ways and carried different meanings. He also rehearsed how he would react physically when the collision took place- he would twist his face in pain, fling his arms, and crouch to show pain and surprise. He really worked hard at his part and performed it to perfection.

<strong>4. Do you agree with the statement that Patol Babu is a practical man who comes to terms with whatever life has to offer? Give reasons for your answer.</strong>

Ans: Patol Babu had a passion for acting. In fact, there was a time when people used to buy tickets just to watch him. But he left all this and moved to Calcutta from Kanchrapara because he was offered a job with a better salary. In Calcutta, he gave up his plans of starting a club in his neighbourhood and dabbled in various jobs to make his ends meet. When an acting offer came by, he readily agreed to do it. Though he was initially disturbed by the triviality of the role, he performed the part to perfection without taking any payment for it. Patol Babu believed it was not about whether the role that an actor plays is major or minor, rather performance of the actor mattered the most. Thus, we can say that Patol Babu was a practical man who accepted whatever came his way.

<strong>5. Why does Patol Babu walk away before he can be paid for his role? What does this reveal about his character?</strong>

Ans: Patol Babu executed his part to perfection. However, he wondered whether the immense effort he had put in to enact a small role would be appreciated by everybody or not. The film unit usually got hold of some people, made them do their parts and paid them a small amount.  They were not bothered about the quality of performance.

Although Patol Babu performed a small role, he felt that taking money for it would be trivialising his performance. He was a true actor for whom creative satisfaction was foremost and not money.

<strong>6. Do you think making a movie is an easy job? Discuss with reference to the story.</strong>

Ans: The story, <em>Patol Babu, Film Star</em>, describes a film shoot. Filmmaking is a long and tedious process. Every scene has to be rehearsed many times before it is finally shot. Plenty of heavy equipments and expensive cameras are used. Film actors have to shoot in extreme weather conditions, sometimes in front of large crowds. The noise and extreme weather can, at times, distract an actor. The production unit has to see minor details, arrange for actors for small roles, and arrange for props. In short making a film is a combined effort of many people.

Paul Stewart (1955-) has written a number of popular books for children. Among his best-known books are 'The Edge Chronicles', 'The Free Lance Novels' and 'The Far Flung Adventure Series'. In this story 'Virtually True' he imagines the human memory enters that of a computer, and that it is possible to influence human mind through the manipulation of psycho-drive games on the computer. He proposes a remote possibility in the realm of fiction.

Sbestian Shultz, a 14 year-old schoolboy, was travelling in a car which met with an accident and he went into a coma. He was playing a psyco-drive game on his laptop. His head struck against the laptop and his computer, as Michel, the narrator believed , saved his memory.

Michael was surprised to find identify between the real Shultz and the Shultz of his video-games. He recalled receiving messages form Shultz on his screen to rescue him. In order to to rescue him, he played four games in all. In the first game Wildwest, he and Shultz tried to evade Black-Eyed Jed, the fastest gun in the world. A gunshot hit the Shultz and he could not be saved. The game was over. In Dragonquest, too, Shultz could not be saved as Michel's sword proved ineffective. In Jailbreak, Shultz and Michel were chased by furious guards and ferocious dogs. Shultz slipped from the staircase. Only in Warzone Michel was able to save Shultz by pulling him into the helicopter.

Strangely, this rescue of the Shultz in the world of games got related to the rescue of the real Shultz from his coma. Shultz proved the doctors wrong and had a miraculous escape from the death. Michel got a note of thanks from real Shultz for saving his life, and suggested a meeting soon. Both knew that ' By reliving the accident, something wonderful had happened. "Michel thought that everything he had described was "true-virtually !".

<strong>Michel:
</strong>Like his father, Michael has passion for computer games. He seems to spend a lot of time on playing 3-D and psycho-drive games . He is quite skillful in playing games. It is through games that we lernt that he is bold, aggressive and helpful. He plays the games not to hit the jackpot but to rescue Shultz in distress.

<strong>Sebestian Shultz:
</strong>The real Sebestian Shultz is the 14 year-old schoolboy. He goes into a coma. he comes out of it the moment his memory is restored by Michael's manipulating the game he used to play. The fictional Shultz is adventurous, clever and schemy, though he fails again and again . He does not give in and encourages Michel to 'rescue' him.

This is a futuristic story which is only true. It brings home the that there can be interaction between two advanced intelligences on the earth- the human intelligence and the computer intelligence. It shows how Michael by manipulating a psycho-drive game on his computer- which has saved the memory of Sebastian Shultz at the time of his going into the coma in an accident- helps save Shultz who miraculously awakes from his coma.

The title of the story 'Virtually True' is quite adaptive. The story of Shultz who goes into a coma has a miraculous recovery. His memory is saved on a computer at the time when his head bangs against the computer. Somehow a boy Michael gets hold of the same disk and plays the games in which the same boy (Shultz) is a character. He rescues him and thus helps the real Shultz awake from his coma. Thus, the story seems to be quite fictive, but theoretically speaking, it is virtually true. Who knows human and computer intelligences may begin to interact one day in future ?

<div id="saq" class="accordion-body collapse">

<strong>1. How did Michael notice the story of Sebastian Shultz?</strong>
Ans : Sitting in the train, Michael saw a big lady, reading a newspaper. There was a story with a title ‘Miracle Recovery’. It was written that Sebastian Shultz, a 14-year- old boy from London, had been badly injured in a motor accident and had gone into a coma. His mother hoped that one day her son would be well and only a miracle could save him.

<strong>2. While playing Wildwest, Michael found himself in a particular role. What was it and how did he behave in the game?</strong>
Ans : To his surprise, Michael was playing the role of a Sheriff and he burst into a saloon. Everyone was surprised by his entry. He had some fizzy kind of drink when a black-eyed Jed, the fastest gun, called him out of the saloon. As he was going, a second Sheriff appeared and he did not look like other characters. His movement was also not like a computer image. His entry made the game more complicated.

<strong>3. Who was Black-Eyed Jed and what did he convey to the Sheriff?</strong>
Ans : Michael was the Sheriff in the game ‘WILDWEST’. When he was enjoying a drink in the saloon, he was challenged by a Black-eyed Jed the fastest gun in the west. He wanted to confront the Sheriff. So he was called out of the saloon.

<strong>4. What was the objective of the second game called Dragon quest? In what role did Sebastian appear in it?</strong>
Ans : The aim of the game DRAGON QUEST was simple. It was to rescue fair princess Aurora from the wicked dragon and to collect the wicked dragon’s treasure. Sebastian appeared in the form of a knight and even Michael was also supposed to be a knight.

<strong>5. How did the two knights try to escape from the castle of the dragon? Were they successful?</strong>
Ans : Both the knights were chased by the wicked dragon. They ran across the battlements down a spiral staircase and through a secret passage on the other side of the tapestry. The dragon was near them and they could feel his fiery breath. Both of them, then decided to try going through the dungeons which was their only hope.

<strong>6. Point out the desperation in Sebastian’s message to Michael. What did he tell Michael to do?</strong>
Ans : When Michael was unable to save Sebastian in the earlier two games, Sebastian’s message becomes desperate. He earnestly requests Michael not to give up, otherwise he would remain stuck up whereever he was. So he wishes him luck and tells him to try the game ‘JAILBREAK’.

<strong>7. How did Michael and Sebastian escape from Jail in Jailbreak? Why was Sebastian injured in this escape?</strong>
Ans : Sebastian was Michael’s cell-mate in the game ‘JAILBREAK’. They use a skeleton swipe card to open the cell-door and run away. Sirens wail, guards run after them, fiery dogs howl and chase them. Both of them run upstairs but they are chased. Before Michael can do something, Sebastian falls down on the concrete below.

<strong>8. How did Michael connect Sebastian’s recovery from coma with the result of his last game?</strong>
Ans : Apparently, at the time of an accident, Sebastian was using his laptop to play one of the psycho-drive games. He had been plugged into the computer and when he banged his head, the computer saved his memory as its own. Those games were stolen when Sebastian was in the hospital. These games were sold in the market and Michael bought them from a Computer Fair.

<strong>9. What were the contents of Sebastian’s last message? Why did Sebastian thank Michael?</strong>
Ans : The last message was full of heart felt emotions. Sebastian thanked Michael for saving his life and working so hard in every game to rescue him. Sebastian extends an invitation to meet him and a wishes him well. He also tells Michael to keep these psycho-drive games as he deserveds to keep them.

<div id="laq" class="accordion-body collapse">

<strong>1. Sebastian Shultz writes his diary on his miraculous escape from going into oblivion—as doctors call it coma. Write this for him.</strong>

Ans : Dear Diary,
Sometimes life takes a strange turn and things that you had heard or read about become true. Virtual lives and realities take concrete shape. I just remember that I was crazy for those psycho-drive games and loved playing WARZONE, DRAGON QUEST etc. My last memory is when my head banged in the accident. After that I have no memory but a very distinct feeling of playing some games. I have read my report in the newspaper, how I had gone into a coma. It can only be called a miracle that I was playing games with another boy called Michael, which I discovered later strange! So very strange.
Sebastian.

<strong>2. Write a brief character sketch of Michael, giving his outstanding qualities that led him to save Sebastian’s life.</strong>

Ans : Michael was of Sebastian’s age and he loved adventure, war, pursuits, fights, confrontation and violent games. Like other children of his age he was a computer freak and was really fascinated by psycho-drive games that make one forget the reality and one plays character like a Sheriff, a prisoner, knight etc. Michael is also very kindhearted and tried his best to rescue Sebastian. He was intelligent enough to understand the objective of each game. By strange luck he got connected to Sebastian, whom he had never seen but proved his perseverance and determination in rescuing him from his coma. Michael is a young child but mature beyond his years.

<strong>3. Sebastian sends an e-mail to Michael on his recovery thanking him for all that he had done. Complete it for him.</strong>

Ans : Date : 15 Sept, 2010
From : <a href="mailto:sebastian@hotmail.com">sebastian@hotmail.com</a>
To : <a href="mailto:michael@gmail.com">michael@gmail.com</a>
Subject : Thank you note
Dear Michael,
I cannot thank you enough for being the miracle to save my life. Your perseverance, tenacity and determination prove that you are extraordinary. No wonder you saved my life and now I have fully recovered from my coma. I hope to meet you soon.
Lots of love.
Sebastian

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[abpoet text="

Shelley was born in 1792 at Field Place, near Horsham, Sussex. He was the son of wealthy land owner who later on succeeded to a baronetcy. He went to study at University College, Oxford and there his chosen studies were metaphysics and religion and soon he developed a passion for reforming the world. Shelly is the great English romantic poet. He is regarded as one of the best lyrical poets. His poems like the 'Old to the West Wind', 'The Cloud', 'To a Skylark', 'To Night' reflect his lyrical quality in abundance. In these poems we notice the spirit of nature which appeals to us in the wind and the cloud, the sunset and the moonrise seems to have possessed him.

His poetry reflects two moods. In one he is the violent reformer, seeking to overthrow the present institutions. In another mood, he is like a wanderer following a vague but beautiful vision.

"]

[abpoem text='

In this sonnet, Shelley illustrates the vanity of human greatness and failure of all attempts to immortalise human achievements. Ozymandias was a great Egyptian king. A life-like statue of the king was made to immortalise him. But now the statue lies broken and disfigured in a desert.

A traveller from Egypt sees two huge and trunk less legs of a statue in a desert. Near them lies , half-buried, the broken face of the statue. On this face one can see the expression of arrogance and a sense of authority which have been skillfully depicted by the sculptor on the statue. On the pedestal the following words are inscribed:

"My name is Ozymandias and I am a great king. Look at the great deeds that I have accomplished and which nobody can equal." The broken statue is surrounded by a vast desert.

The title of the poem is named after the great Egyptian king named Ozymandias. The title is very adaptive because the whole poem revolves around his character. The poet illustrates Ozymandias' vanity, arrogance and pride and his failure to immortalise himself by getting his statue made. Time has played havoc with his statue and it lies broken and disfigured in a desert. The poem reflects that human glory and promp are nort everlasting. The poet strikes a moral by depicting the futility of Ozymandias' vanity and pride.

<strong>1 – 8 lines – (I met a traveller .................... that fed)</strong>

The speaker recalls having met a traveller from an ancient land who told him a story about the ruins of a state in the desert of his native country. The traveller said that two vast legs of stone stand without a body and near this, a massive crumbling and broken stone-head lies, which is half sunk in the sand. The statue has a bitter and cruel expression of ‘sneer and cold command’ and this indicates that the sculptor had understood the passions of his subject really well. It was obvious that the statue was of a man who sneered with contempt for those who were weaker than himself, yet fed his people because of something in his heart.

<strong>9 – 14 lines – (My name ......................... far away)</strong>

On the pedestal of the statue these words are inscribed, ‘‘My name is Ozymandias, I am the king of kings. If anyone wishes to know how great I am, then let him surpass any of my works. Around the decaying ruin of the statue, nothing remains, only the ‘lone’ and level sands’ which stretch out around it, far away.

<strong>9.What impression do you form of and sculptor ?</strong>

Ans: The sculptor appears to be very competent, skillful and observant. He observed that the king was vain, roud, arrogant and had a sense of authority. So he captured the feelings and passion of the king in statue of the king very skilfully.

<strong>10. How did the poet come to know about the broken statue of Ozymandias?</strong>

Ans : The poet was told the story of Ozymandias by a speaker who had met a traveller from an ancient land. The story and the condition of Ozymandias’ statue is conveyed by word of mouth. This adds a tinge of obscurity and mystery to the statue.

<strong>11. In what condition was the statue found?</strong>

So his boast could never be justified.

"]

[laq text="

<strong>1. Give the chacacter-sketch of king Ozymandias as depicted in the poem.</strong>

Ans : King Ozymandias considered himself to be the king of kings. He ruled over his empire with a firm hand. He fed his subjects but regarded them as inferior. He was boastful of his power and considered himself to be above all. He believed that no one will ever be able to equal his achievements. He considered himself to be blessed with extraordinary powers. The king was so intoxicated with power and passion that the welfare of his people was never his consideration. He believed himself to be above law and destiny. Ironically his statue and the surroundings proved just the opposite. He believed himself to be even greater than other kings — the Emperor of all.

<strong>2. Suppose by a miracle Ozymandias visits planet Earth and comes across his statue in that dilapidated state. He is dejected and awakens to the realisation of a life frittered away for materialistic and political gains. In a state of regret he pens down his thoughts in the form of a diary entry. Write the diary for him.</strong>

Ans : Dear Diary,

Traversing over the desert, I was dumbfounded with great shock when I discovered that my statue was lying broken, without head and body, in an eroded state. Imagine my reaction. I had considered myself above all, I was the greatest, the mightiest, and I believed that the coming generations would worship or pay respect to my statue. The condition of my statue pained me. All my achievements, my confidence in my power was razed to the ground. There were sands and loneliness around. No one seemed to remember my greatness. May be I was wrong. I should have devoted my life to welfare, looked after my people with compassion and care, maybe then the fate of my statue would have been different.  Ozymandias.

<strong>3. After reading the poem, what is the lesson ingrained in it for the rest of mankind? Discuss.</strong>

Ans : Power, position, pelf should be used for the welfare of mankind. History may record one’s territorial achievements but if one wins the hearts of people, then that is real victory. One must command respect and not demand it. Many times sages and saints are respected more than mighty kings. So one must never misuse power and might. Time is a great leveller. So glorious deeds should be committed to get respect from posterity. Shelley also demonstrates the fact that art and language long outlive the other legacies of power. Real power is winning hearts and not in ruling the weak and the needy.

[ncert text="

<center><strong>Short</strong></center><strong>1. ‘‘The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed’’. Whose hand and heart has the poet referred to in this line?</strong>

Ans: The poet refers to the sculptor's hand which reproduced the king's feelings on stone. Then the poet refers to the king's heart ehich nourished those feelings and passion in his heart.

<strong>2. ‘‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings’’. Why does Ozymandias refer to himself as ‘king of kings’ ? What quality of the king is revealed through this statement ?</strong>

Ans: Ozymandias refers himself as king of kings because he thinks that he is the gretest king of all kings due to his great deeds, achievements and victories. Nobody can become as great as he is. The vanity, pride and arrogance of the king are revealed through this statement.

<strong>3. ‘‘Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair ’’! Who is Ozymandias referring to when he speaks of ye Mighty? Why should they despair?</strong>

Ans: Ozymandias is referring to other poweful and brave warriors. He wants to tell them that they should hive up all hopes of equalling him. He is great and powerful because of his great deeds, achievements and victories. The should despair because they cannot become as great and powerful as he is.

<strong>4. Bring out the Irony in the poem.</strong>

Ans: Ozymandias, the great king of Egypt, gets his statue made in order to immortalise himself. He excepts that his name will live till posterity. But time plays havoc with the statue. The statue lies broken and disfigures and orrounded with barren desert. His expectation is belied and thus the whole situation is ironical.

<strong>5. “Nothing beside remains”. What does the narrator mean when he says these words?</strong>

Ans: The narrator means to say that the statue lies broken and disfiured and is suroounded by barren desert. There is nothing else to be seen near the statue. A vast, desolate and barren dessert sorrounds the remains of the huge statue which lies broken.

<strong>6. What is your impression of Ozymandias as a king ?</strong>

Ans: After reading the poem, we come to know that Ozymandias is proud, vain and arrogant king. At the sme time we find that is mighty and brave king because of his great deeds, achievements and victories. No othr king could ho[e to equall him and become as great and powerful as he was.

<strong>7. What message is conveyed in the poem ‘‘Ozymandias’’?</strong>

Ans: In this poem the poet wants to convey the vanity of human greatness and the faliure of all attempts to immortalise human gandure. Ozymandias, the great king of Egypt, gets his statue made in order to immortalise himself.  But the time plays havoc eith the statue and now it lies broken and disfigured in a desert. Thus, the poet conveys a message that human gloy and peomp are not everlasting.

<center><strong>Long</strong></center><strong>1. Discuss the poetic style of the poem, ‘‘Ozymandias’’.</strong>

Ans: Ozymandias written in 1817 is a very masterful sonnet by Shelley. It is written in iambic pentameter and was an unusual rhyme-scheme. The poem interlinks the octave by gradually replacing old rhymes with new ones in the form of ABABACDCEDEFEF.

This sonnet is Shelly’s brilliant rendering of the story of a powerful king. Framing the sonnet as a story told to the speaker by ‘‘a traveller from an antique land’’, enables Shelley to add another level of obscurity to Ozymandia’s position with regard to the reader. Rather than seeing the statue with our own eyes, we hear it from someone who has heard from another source, so and so forth. Thus the ancient king is rendered less commanding. The distancing of the narrative serves to undermine his power over us, like the passage of time. Shelley gradually reconstructs the figure of the king. First we see the ‘‘vast trunkless legs,’’ then the ‘shattered visage’’ and, then the inscription. The expression on the king’s face, then we are introduced to the king’s people of his time. The kingdom is now imaginatively complete and we are introduced to the proud boast of the king. With this the poet demolishes our imaginary picture of the king, with centuries of ruin and bare sands between it and us. Basically the poet is devoted to a single metaphor throughout the poem – the shattered ruined statue in the desert waste land with its arrogant and passionate face.

D.H. Lawrence (1885-1930) is primarily one of the greatest English novelists of 20th century. He is widely known for his novels like 'Sons and Lovers' and 'Two Women'. His novels reflect the complexity of relationship between man and women. But he is a versatile writer. Besides being a novelist he is a story writer, critic, poet and painter.

[abpoem text="

The poem Snake by D.H.Lawrence, is more or less like an ode, celebrating the encounter of the poet with a snake that came as a trespasser into his domain for water. The poem starts by indicating the event, the time and the atmosphere. The snake to quench its thirst went to the poet's “water – trough” on a “hot day”. Also, the poet who is the owner of the water trough, came for the same purpose in his pyjamas to avoid the “heat”. The poet is said to be coming from his “strange – scented shade” with a “pitcher” in his hand. On reaching the water trough, the poet, as a matter of courtesy, chose to wait to enable the snake to drink as it was the first to reach there. The snake whose origin was from a fissure in the earth-wall, slither slowly with its “yellow-brown”, “soft belly” to the “edge of the stone trough”. The snake rested its “throat upon the stone bottom” and started drinking softly through its mouth into “his slack long body”. The poet referred himself as a “second comer” waiting for the snake to finish drinking. The poet, while waiting, observed its mode of drinking and described it as that of cattle. The poet could hear the “voice” of his education and resolved to kill the snake, “for in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold are venomous”. This implies that the poet believed that black snakes are harmless while gold snakes are harmful, making a reference to "Sicilian July" and "Etna smoking", which are both historical events. The poet's inner voice prompted him to kill the snake but was restrained believing that the snake “should seek hospitality” in him. For sparing the snake, the poet felt so honoured. The snake having shown hospitality “drank enough and lifted its head” “and flickered his tongue”. Having quenched its thirst, the snake turned around slowly with it's long curved body towards it's origin. The snake moved in slowly into the hole without any fear. Suddenly, the poet looked around and put down his pitcher, “picked up clumsy log and threw it at the water-trough”. This was done to kill the snake but it did not. The snake hearing the “clatter” hastily moved in its remaining body “into the black hole”. At the disappearance of the snake, the poet regretted his action immediately and blamed himself for acting the way he did. He put the blame on the voice of his education to have lured him into it and feared not to pay for his negative action like the sailor that killed “the albatross”. The poet after regretting wished the snake could come back for him to crown it like a king but believed it would never do so and sees it “like a king in exile”. The poet concluded by feeling that he had to make an amendment.

[title text="

The title of the poem snake is appropriate because the poet describes his encounter with the snake who had come to drink water from his water trough on a hot day. The snake came there to quench his thirst. He came out from the crack and trailed over the edge of the stone trough. He rested his throat upon the stone bottom and sipped the water into his slack long body.

The poet thought of killing the snake. However, he instinctively began to like the snake. Then the poet describes his responses to the presence of the snake at his water trough. After drinking water to his satisfaction, the snake licked his lips and drew into his hole. The poet picked up a long and hurled at the snake. The snake twisted violently and then vanished into the hole.

The poet regretted his action and felt guilty. He realised that he had to atone for his mean action. The whole poem revolves around the snake. Therefore the title is adaptive.

[pphrase text="

<strong>A snake ......................................................... stone bottom.</strong>

A snake visited the poet’s water trough on a very hot afternoon to quench his thirst. The water trough was under the shade of a red flowery tree, which let out a strange kind of scent. The poet who had also gone to the trough to fill water in a pitcher waited for the snake to finish, since he had come to the trough earlier than the poet. The poet is very particular regarding protocol, so he believes that he must wait for his turn to take the water.

<strong>And ware ............................................................... waiting.</strong>

The snake had come from a crack in the wall made of earth and from the darkness, it comes out to the edge of the water trough. The snake is yellow brown in colour, with a soft belly, it must have come slowly to the water trough. The snake rested his throat upon the stone-bottom and sipped the water into his slack long body. The snake did this very silently. The poet waited for his turn, since he had come after the snake’s arrival.

<strong>He lifted ....................................................... Etna smoking.</strong>

The snake relaxed in between and lifted his head after drinking water like cattle. He appeared to be looking in the poet’s direction and the poet could see his forked tongue. The snake appeared to think for a few moments then again bent down and drank some more water. The snake was brown like the earth and he had come out from the burning bottom of the earth. It was a very very hot day in Sicily, in the month of July, and Mount Etna, an active volcano, was also sending out fumes, making the day hotter.

<strong>The voice ............................................................... him off.</strong>

Education and social conventions make the poet think that the golden brown snakes were poisonous, so they must be killed. Black snakes were considered harmless but brown ones were dangerous. As a brave man, he must undertake the task of killing the snake.

<strong>But must ............................................................ this earth?</strong>

The poet makes a frank confession that he really liked the snake so he didn’t feel like killing him. The snake had come like a guest to drink water from the poet’s water trough and was going to depart in a peaceful and satisfied manner. The snake would eventually go back in the hot and scorching bowels of the earth.

<strong>Was it .............................................................. secret earth.</strong>

The voices of education in the poet told him that it was the fear of the snake that made him refrain from killing him. However the poet felt that though he was quite afraid of the snake, he did actually feel honoured that a snake had come to seek his hospitality from the deep recesses of the earth

<strong>He drank .............................................................. wall-face.</strong>

The snake drank enough water to his satisfaction and then raised his head dreamily and flickered his tongue. He seemed to lick his lips. He looked around like a God and then slowly proceeded to curve round and move away from the water trough. The snake moved so slowly as if he was dreaming or was asleep and again went back to climb the wall with the crack, from where he had come.

<strong>And as he ......................................................... was turned.</strong>

The snake put his head inside the crack and then easing his shoulders, entered deep inside the hole. The poet disliked the retreat of the snake into the dark and deep horrible hole. A sort of protest rose in the poet’s mind and he became quite agitated, the moment the snake turned his back.

<strong>I looked ...................................................... with fascination.</strong>

The poet put down his pitcher, picked up a log and hurled it at the snake. The snake twisted violently and with great agility vanished into the hole in the wall. The tail of the snake which had been left also vanished in great haste like lightning. The snake had entered the crack in the wall. All the poet could do was to stare with fascination at the manner in which the snake had disappeared.

<strong>And immediately .................................................... education.</strong>

The poet was full of guilt and felt that he must atone for the meanness of his action of throwing a log at the snake. He really hated himself for such a mean act and cursed the voice of education that had always taught him to kill snakes, without any reason. Just as the Ancient Mariner had killed the albatross without any reason the poet had also tried to strike at the snake for no reason. He really prayed and wished for the snake to come back.

<strong>And I thought .................................................. crowned again.</strong>

The poet felt that the snake had behaved in a dignified manner like a king and he was also the king of the underworld. The snake was inside the earth, like a king in exile. Now enough was enough and the poet wished to give due respect to the snake that was befitting of a king.

<strong>And so, ............................................................. a pettiness.</strong>

The poet deeply regretted his mean act of trying to kill the snake. He had really missed the chance of treating the snake well, of giving him respect that is due to a king. Now he would have to make amends for his petty and mean act.

[saq text="

<strong>1. Why does the poet repeat “hot”, “must wait” twice? What purpose does it serve?</strong>

Ans : These words are used repeatedly because the poet wishes to emphasise on them. ‘Hot’ means very hot as there are many reasons like the month of July, Etna volcano etc. ‘Must wait’ means compulsion. The poet believes that anyone who comes first, must be served first.

<strong>2. From where had the snake emerged? What do you think was the reason for the snake to come out in the open?</strong>

Ans : The snake had come out from the crack in the wall. It was very hot and scorching inside due to July month, active volcano etc. The snake wanted to drink water and satisfy his thirst.

<strong>3. Describe the relaxed manner in which the snake makes his way to the water trough and the manner in which he drinks water.</strong>

Ans : The movement of the snake is described as ‘slack’ ‘soft-bellied’, most relaxed and unhurried. He appeared out of a crack in the wall and very languorously stretched himself and slow crawled to the edge of the water-trough. One reason could be that he had not seen the poet.

<strong>4. Why is the snake compared to cattle?</strong>

Ans : The relaxed manner in which the snake drinks water reminds the poet of cattle. Even the cattle drink water, then look up, muse a moment and continue. The snake also behaves similarly.

<strong>5. How were the poet’s beliefs regarding snakes conditioned by society?</strong>

Ans : Society ingrains certain preconceived notions in our mind and due to that we don’t judge situations by instinct — The poet was fascinated by the snake. He appreciated the snake’s majestic and harmless nature but the earlier instincts drilled in him by society force him to strike at the snake. He had been taught to kill snakes.

<strong>6. Explain – ‘And depart peaceful, pacified and thankless’.</strong>

Ans : The snake appeared to be pacified and satisfied, for he had taken water generously. He was not the harmless kind, neither had the poet given him any reason, so there was no confrontation. The poet believes that the snake has no reason to thank the poet for a natural resource like water which is God’s gift for all.

<strong>7. Why does the poet feel honoured by the presence of the snake?</strong>

Ans : The poet feels obliged that the snake had come all the way from the inner depths of the earth to his water trough and this was a kind of honour. Moreover the snake is so regal and majestic in his bearing that the poet feels honoured to have him as his guest.

<strong>8. The poet is too impressed with the majestic manner in which the snake conducts himself. What comparisons does the poet make to highlight this behaviour of the snake?</strong>

Ans : The manner in which the snake drinks water is like the cattle. He appears to muse a bit, drink with intervals. The snake is called ‘Lord of life’ because life and death is in his hands. He is also compared to ‘a king’ for his majestic style and when he quickly disappears he is compared to lightening.

<strong>9. Why did the poet have a sudden urge to hit the snake? Do you think he was justified in trying to hit the snake, when its back was turned?</strong>

Ans : When the snake’s back is turned, the ‘voices of education’ that were troubling the poet, overtake him. He hits the snake with a stick which was quite unjustified. The snake had not troubled the poet and one must behave with one’s instincts than preconceived notions.

<strong>10. Why did the poet despise himself? Mention the three words that he uses to describe his action.</strong>

Ans : The poet feels very guilty of trying to hit at the snake. He calls his act ‘mean’ ‘petty’ and feels like making amends. The poet believes that he must compensate for his unreasonable and undignified act. He uses the words ‘to expiate’, which express his feelings.

[laq text="

<strong>1. Describe the manner in which the snake arrived and departed.</strong>

Ans : The snake had come from the crack in the wall made of earth, from the darkness, from the scorching inside portion of the earth. The snake did not feel the threat of the poet’s presence, so its movement is very languid, very relaxed and unhurried. It stretched its long and slack body, drank water with great spells of flavour and enjoyment. It licked its lips, it mused and put his head on the edge of the water-trough. Its departure was exactly the opposite, quick, clumsy, abrupt like the speed of lightening.

<strong>2. You have read the poem ‘snake’ and you understand the dilemma faced by the poet. Suppose you had been there instead of the poet, how would you have behaved? Write a letter to your friends Prateek, expressing this situation and how did you resolve it.</strong>

Ans : 92, G.P. Road  ABC City  12 July, 2010  Dear Prateek,  I wish to recount a strange experience that I underwent recently. One day as I had come to fill my pitcher with water from a open water-trough, I saw a snake drinking water there. My first instinct was fright and then I felt like killing him, because that is what we do generally. Nevertheless, I hid behind the door and watched the snake. The snake was very relaxed, very slack and had great style of moving about. After drinking water, the snake went back into the hole. I felt happy that I had not hit him. I am happy I followed the voice of my instincts.  Mohan.

<strong>3. Write a short note on the literary devices used by the poet. Discuss their effectiveness in the context of the poem.</strong>

Ans : D.H. Lawrence has made use of many literary devices liberally. He begins the poem by using some words expressions repeatedly, to reinforce and highlight certain ideas. There is a great use of alliteration in words like ‘slackness’, ‘soft-bellied’ etc. Lot of similes have been used to describe the snake. The snake is compared to ‘cattle’ ‘like a king’ ‘Lord’ etc. The snake disappears into the hole with the speed of lightening. Moreover the snake is symbolic of some strange forces and it represents power and sophistication that impress the poet.

S.T. Coleridge is one of the well-known Romantic English poets. He is known for his poem like 'Kubla Khan', 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' and 'Christabel' and his critical work Biographia Literaria. In 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner', he highlights the Christian concept of sin, punishment and redemption through the story of the old Mariner who happens to kill an albatross.

"]

[abpoem text="

The old mariner with grey beard and the 'glittering eye' stops one of the three persons going to attend the wedding feast. The man is in no mood to listen to his story. He is a close relative of the bridegroom. But transfixed by the 'gilttering eye' of the mariner, he has to sit on a stone and listen to his story.

The mariner begins to narrate his story. when they started there voyage, they were given a warm send off. The weather remained good for some days. Then a storm arose. It drove the ship towards the icy south pole. There were snow and mist. It was very cold. Then the albatross- a huge sea bird- appeared. It followed the ship. A wind helped the ship come out of the cold region. The albatross followed behind the ship. It was considered to be the bird of the good omen. Then one day the old mariner shot the bird dead with his crossbow without and reason.

The weather remained fine. The crew who condemned their mate for killing the bird t first changed their opinion about the bird. They thought that it was the bird that had brought the mist. There shipmate was right in killing it, believed.

When the ship reached the equator the breeze stopped. It was very hot. The ship was stranded. There was no water to drink. The sea was muddy. Strange creatures fell in and out of the water around the ship.

Some sailors dreamed of the spirit that wanted to take revenge for the killing of the albatross. without the wind and the water the sailors felt silent. They could not speak. The held the old mariner responsible for their sufferings. They snatched the cross from the old mariners neck, and hung the dead albatross in its place. The dead albatross around his neck was the constant reminder of his guilt.

"]

[title text="

The us of word 'Rime' suggests that the poem is a rhyming poem, a song. 'Ancient' not only indicates that it is the poem about an old sailor (seaman), but also the "strange, far off time" the action of the poem apparently belongs to. It containd the story of his sin, punishment and redemption the Ancient Mariner narrates to the Wedding-Guest. Thus, the title of the poem is very adaptive and suggestive.

"]

[pphrase text="

<strong>Lines 1-4 :</strong>

An Ancient Mariner stopped one of three guests invited to a wedding. The guest was bewitched by the long grey beard and the shining eyes of the Mariner. But he did not like being interrupted and asked the Mariner why he had been detained.

<strong>Lines 5-8 :</strong>

He said that the doors of bridegroom's house were wide open. He being colsely related to the bridegroom was expected to reach there very soon. The guests had been already arrived there. The feast was set. The noise of merry-making could be haerd even from where they were standing.

<strong>Lines 9-12 :</strong>

The Mariner

[theme text="

The poem primarily deal with Christianity and the supernatural. The old mariner impulsively shoots the Albatross and this act results in his agony and misery. Coleridge believed that the seeds of creations and destruction are interlinked. Destruction leads to new creation. The loss of mariner's ship and his own former self leads to his regeneration.

Some of the other major themes the poem deals with are:
<ul>
	<li>Sin and Redemption:- Man commits sin, but if he repents his wrongdoings and performs penance he gets salvation. The protagonist, the Ancient Mariner, who commits a sin by killing the albatross, is hounded by guilt in the form of a strange supernatural phenomena. During this terrifying experience, her has a change of heart and repents his wrong doing. He pays penalty by traveling around the world to tell his tale to strangers.</li>
	<li>Respect for Nature:- Human beings should respect all of God's creations , including the Albatross. In doing so, people indicate their respect for the Creator himself.</li>
</ul>
"]

[col url="idea" title="Central Idea of the Poem" text=" The poem portrays man's intense quest for salvation from the sins he has committed during the journey of his existence. The albatross symbolises Christianity, stating 'as if it had been a Christian Soul.' The presence of the Albatross was significant to the crew in terms of spirituality which manifests itself through signs both symbolic and mysterious. "]

[laq text="

<strong>1. The poem is a narration about crime and punishment. Elucidate.</strong>

Ans. The ship gets stuck in the South Pole region until an Albatross appears out of the mist. It is hailed in God's name. It leads the ship and its crew out of the threatening realm of ice and snow. The Ancient Mariner kills it impulsively. This act arouses the wrath of the supernatural forces. The winds drive the ship to uncharted waters where it is becalmed. The sailors believe the Albatross's spirit is following them and causing them agony. Tormented by thirst, the members of the crew punish the Ancient Mariner by hanging the Albatross around his neck as a constant reminder of his wicked act.

<strong>2. What was the initial reaction of the Sailors when the old mariner shot the albatross? Why did they later approve of his act?</strong>

Ans. Initially, the sailors blamed the old mariner for killing the bird whose arrival had made the ice break apart, allowing them to steer out of the freezing cold. Later, when the weather became pleasant, they approved of its killing as it had brought mist and snow."] ]]></content:encoded>

<p>William Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564 at Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire. He was the son of John and Mary Shakespeare. John Shakespeare was proposed businessman. When seven years of age, Shakespeare was admitted into a Grammar School. At the age of fourteen. Shakespeare has to leave school. In 1528, when Shakespeare was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. In 1587, he left Stratford for London. It appears that he was in considerable strains for want of money. Between 1588 and 1589, he commenced writing his great plays, the first being Loves's Labour Lost.</p>
<p>In 1597, at the age of thirty-three, Shakespeare returned to Stratford and bought a house there, which he called New Palace. At New Palace, he lived until his death in 1616. He was buried in Stratford Church, where his monuments is still to be seen.</p>

<p>Leading scholars believe that Julius Caesar was written about 1598-99. It was the first of the three Roman plays (the other two being Antony and Cleopatra, 1608 and Coriolanus, 1610). Julius Caesar is and historical play, as it deals with the historical events that took place in ancient Rome between 44 B.C. and 42 B.C. The characters in the play, namely Julius Caesar, Marcus Brutus, Caius Cassius, Mark Antony and others are all historical persons, who actually existed in Rome. But it is important to note that a dramatist often takes liberties with history.</p>

<p>Roman citizens are preparing to welcome Julius Caesar, who is returning home after having achieved victory over the sons of Pompey. The people of Rome are rejoicing and are in a holiday mood. The Tribunes do not like that people should rejoice. They are the followers of the Pompey and are Republicans. They are opposed to Caesar who they consider to be a dictator. They disperse the gathering crowds, telling them that Caesar is the enemy of the Republic which Pompey tried to strengthen. Caesar, however is too popular and powerful to be opposed by Tribunes. The triumphal procession takes place on the day of Lupercal when public games are held. Brutus and Cassius are present on the occation. Cassius begins to flatter the Brutus with intention of gaining his moral support for the conspiracy, which he is hatching. Cassius has private grudge against Caesar. He is only waiting to enlist the support of Brutus since Brutus is dearest friend of Caesar. Brutus is an ideal Republican who hates all absolute rule and dictatorship. Cassius cleverly puts into his mind the fear that Rome is in the danger of losing its freedom as a Republic. Brutus is won over this way. The group of conspirators, including Brutus and Cassius go to the senate House where Caesar is preceding. They present to himself a petition on behalf of omen Climber who has been banished by Caesar. They pray to Caesar for his recall. When Caesar turns down their requests, they stab him and kill him. Soon, the people of the Roe demand that they be satisfied with the Caesar's murder - Caesar who was deeply respected and loved by them. At the funeral of Caesar, Brutus goes into the pulpit to explain the murder. He tells the crowd that Caesar has been put to death because he was ambitious to become the king of Rome. After Brutus finishes his address, Antony is given an opportunity to speak. Antony is one of the follower of the Caesar. In his speech Antony exposes the claim of the conspirators. He incites the mob to mutiny. He also shows them Caesar's will in which Caesar has generously gifted money to every Roman citizen. The people rise up in revolt against the conspirators, burn their houses, kill some of them and force Cassius and Brutus to flee from Rome.</p>

<p><strong>Julius Caesar</strong><br />
Julius Caesar is the great warrior and popular ruler. he has won many battles and defeated Pompey's sons. He is worshipped by the people. He is quite fearless. He prides himself o his resolution. He remains unmoved by the request of the senators. His stubborn attitude makes many people hostile. He had no belief in superstitions, spirits and omens. He rejects the fears created by the Soothsayer. Even after his death, he continues to be a powerful force and influence. His spirit refuses to die.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Brutus</strong><br />
Marcus Brutus holds a high position in Rome. He is much respected for his nobility and selflessness. He is a nationalist. He loves freedom and republicanism. When he is sure that his friend Caesar has become a dictator, he sides with his enemies. In fact, he is blinded by his over-confidence. This over-confidence becomes the cause of his failure, defeat and death. He makes a blunder in allowing Antony to deliver the funeral speech.</p>
<p><strong>Cassius</strong><br />
Cassius is Caesars enemy. It is who builds a conspiracy against Caesar. He is jealous of Caesar. He is practical. He knows that without the help of Brutus, the forces of conspiracy cannot win. So he does his best in seeking the support of Brutus. In spite of his weakness, he has extreme love for his country. He loves freedom. He is convinced that Caesar will become dictator and put an end to their freedom. So when he learns that Caesar is to wear the crown, he promises to himself to work against Caesar.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Antony</strong><br />
Mark Antony is firmly devoted to Caesar. When Caesar is killed, he decides to take the revenge on Caesar's enemies. He is quite cunning and scummy. At first, he befriends the conspirators. Then he turns the wave against them. His funeral speech reveals that he is a stubble orator who can play on the emotions of his listeners. He is a leisure-loving person. He is fond of play.</p>
<p><strong>Portia</strong><br />
Portia is Brutus's wife and Cato's daughter. She is worthy of sharing her husband's secrets. She is a true and honourable wife. She stands by her husbands in all her circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of Mob</strong><br />
Shakespeare has portrayed the mob mentality very realistically. When one is in the mob, he loses his own conviction, he is swayed by the collective sense of conviction. the mob in 'Julius Caesar' is depicted as headless, senseless and fickle minded. When Brutus addressed the people they are easily convinced that Caesar was ambitious. But when Antony swayed the mob with his powerful speech, the mob is ready to chase the conspirators and destroy their houses.</p>

<div id="theme" class="accordion-body collapse">
<p>One of the main themes of this play is over-confidence a a human weakness. Over-confidence makes one proud and unkind. It makes oe short-sighted and blind of one's weakness. Julius Caesar in his over-confidence ignores the pleas f his Senators. He fails to judge the pulse of the people. He fails to retain the confidence of even his close friend like Brutus. He has to pay a heavy price for this weakness. Marcus Brutus is another character who falls with a victim of over-confidence. It is in over-confidence that allows Antony to deliver a funeral speech, which turns the public against him and his associative. Over-confidence leads to his defeat and death.</p>

<p>the title of the play 'Julius Caesars' is quite apt. Julius Caesar is the hero pf the play. The play is mainly about him. Even after his death, Caesar is potential force to reckon with. From the beginning to end, it is Caesar or his spirit that remains the cause of concern to others. He remains a towering figure. Without him, nothing is of interest. Therefore, the play has got an appropriate title. We cannot think of any other better title.</p>

<ul>
<li>A legitimate dramatic device : It plays an active and significant part.</li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>

<p>[ncert text="(a) How do the heavens ‘blaze forth’ the death of Julius Caesar?
Ans. Calpurnia sees ill-omens that predict the death of Caesar beforehand. The heavens predict the death of princes and great kings. There were fierce battles, blood rained, ghosts were seen, graves opened up, battle cries were heard. All this signaled that someone as powerful as Caesar was bound to suffer.

(b) What does Calpurnia convince Caesar of?
Ans. She convinces Caesar to avoid going to the senate. She believed that Caesar would be safe if he stays at home.

(c) Why does Calpurnia say Caesar’s ‘wisdom is consumed in confidence?’ What does it mean?
Ans. When Caesar is adamant about going to the senate, Calpurnia dissuades him. But Caesar believes that ill-omens are for the weak and not for the mighty like him. Then Calpurnia says that Caesar’s over confidence has clouded his wisdom. He was so confident that he refused to see reason nor understood the indication behind the ill omens.

(d) What was Calpurnia’s dream? How was it interpreted by Decius Brutus?
Ans. Calpurnia sees a terrifying dream in which Caesar is murdered, his statue is gushing blood and many smiling Romans are bathing their hands in his blood. Calpurnia was not superstitious but earlier in the night she had a nightmare comprising the dead man walking about. She felt that the dream was a premonition of the evil that was going to befall Caesar. So she forbids Caesar to go to the Senate. But Decius cleverly interprets it positively. He says that the vision of Romans bathing in Caesar’s blood signifies that Caesar’s spirit or influence will touch many lives; staining their handkerchieves in Caesar’s blood indicates reverence, dedication and a token of memory on part of the Romans.

(e) What arguments did Brutus and other conspirators give to justify the killing of Caesar?
Ans. Julius Caesar is an able general and a mighty conqueror who has brought great glory to Rome. It is believed by many that Caesar is too ambitious and would one day be the Roman emperor and a dictator. Jealous of Caesar’s growing power, Cassius instigates a conspiracy to murder Caesar. The conspirators were unhappy with Caesar’s obstinacy and egoistic behaviour. Cassius was jealous of Caesar’s soaring power and popularity. According to Cassius, Caesar was a tyrant who wanted to treat the Romans as slaves and that Roman liberty and democracy were under threat from Caesar. Brutus stabbed Caesar because he was an idealist and believed that ambition and tyranny should be nipped in the bud but Cassius killed Caesar because he wanted to be a part of the Roman triumvirate.

(f) Why is Decius more successful than Calpurnia in persuading Caesar?
Ans. Decius interprets Calpurnia’s dream as a fair and fortunate vision. He says that the vision of Romans bathing in Caesar’s blood signifies Caesar’s spirit or influence will increase manifold. Basically he boosts
Caesar’s ego flatters his greatness and might and makes him feel more powerful. So Caesar is happier with his version.

(g) What is the petition put before Caesar by the conspirators? How does Caesar respond to it?
Ans. The conspirators want Caesar to pardon Publius Cimber and recall the order of his banishment. Caesar refuses the request and says that his order cannot be changed and he will stick to his decision.

(h) Who says ‘Ete tu Brute’? When and why?
Ans. Caesar utters these words which mean, ‘‘you too, Brutus’‘. These are uttered when Brutus stabs Caesar and Caesar is too hurt to see that even his dear friend Brutus could resort to such treachery.

(i) In the moments following Caesar’s death, how do the conspirators proclaim to justify Caesar’s death?
Ans. The conspirators wish to justify Caesar’s death by announcing their love and loyalty to Rome. They say that Caesar was very ambitious and Romans would have become slaves under his autocratic rule. According to Brutus, Caesar was a tyrant and Roman liberty and democracy was under threat and Caesar wished to become an Emperor.

(j) What does Antony say after Caesar’s death, when he sees the body of Caesar?
Ans. Antony apologizes to Caesar’s body for being meek and gentle with his murderers. He curses the hands that killed such a noble man. He also requests them to kill him for he cannot tolerate Caesar’s death.

(k) How do Brutus and Cassius respond to Antony’s speech?
Ans. Both Brutus and Cassius request Antony not to plead for his own death. They offer him authority and good position and ask for his support in the murder of Caesar.

(l) Whom does Antony call ‘‘the choice and master spirits of this age’‘. Why?
Ans. Antony calls Brutus and Cassius the most powerful people after Caesar’s death, they have all the power. Moreover he wants to flatter their ego, to pretend that he is not against them.

(m) How do Brutus and Cassius respond to Antony’s request for giving a speech? What are the conditions imposed by them?
Ans. Cassius is very much against Antony’s idea of speech but Brutus feels that no harm can befall him and others with just a speech. Brutus says that he will give a speech first and justify Caesar’s death so there will not be a problem, if Antony delivers his speech later. Moreover Antony is had agreed to deliver the speech from the same platform and not talk against them.

(n) When he is left alone with the body of Caesar what does Antony call Brutus and others?
Ans. Antony curses the murderers and he seeks forgiveness for being polite to them. He calls them ‘butchers’ who killed the noblest of men.

(o) What prediction does Antony make regarding the future events in Rome?
Ans. Antony prophesies that Rome will be ravaged with civil war, violence and extreme blood shed will leave the earth full of dead bodies. Goddess of revenge will descend on earth with Caesar’s spirit and the stench of dead bodies will fill the earth.

(p) Who says ‘‘let him be Caesar’‘? What light does this throw on the speaker?
Ans. The 3rd citizen says this. This statement reflects on the vulnerability of the mob which believes, whatever is told to it. They say that Brutus should be put in place of Caesar, after being impressed by his speech. Later they turn towards Mark Antony and are ready to kill Brutus and others.

Born in 1896, A.J. Croni was a doctor by profession. His first novel Hatter's Castle became very popular, as a result of which he stopped practising medicine and took to writing as career. He wrote many novels and short stories. The Citadel, The Key of The Kingdom and The Spanish Gardener are his notable novels.

The title of his story 'Two Gentlemen of Verona' is taken from an early play of William Shakespeare. The story tells about the hardships faced by two sincere and selfless young boys for the treatment of their sister suffering from tuberculosis. It conveys the idea that there is a hope for humanity so long as people are willing to make sacrifices for the well-bing of others.

He said that they seemed to earn adequate money, and asked why they were then spending no money on the clothes and food. Nicola said that they had some plans in their mind but did not elaborate.

Jacopo requested the narrator to carry them in his car to village Poleta, 30 kms from there. He said it would be a great favour.

Ski, the story writer, was born in 1870 and passed away in 1916. His real name was Hector Hugh Munro, a British writer. He is known for his witty and satirical stories, most of which have surprise endings.

'Mrs Packletide's Tiger' is a satire in the vanity of women who go to extremes to show their superiority over the rivals. Mrs Packletide wanted to shoot a tiger only to prove that she was no less then Loona Bimberton who had been carried miles in an aeroplane and continued to boast about it. Though she 'killed' a tiger yet she had to pay a heavy price to satisfy her vanity.

Mrs Packletide wants to hog the limelight by killing a tiger. Her intention was to surprise the achievement of Loona Bimberton who had been boasting of having been carried away eleven miles in an aeroplane by an Algerian aviator. She wanted to have personally produced tiger skin. She had in her mind to host a party in honour of Loona Bimberton, with a tiger-skin rug occupying most of the foreground. She would then boast of her achievement. She also intend to present a tiger-claw brooch to Loona Bimberton on her next birthday

So she offered a thousand rupees for the risk free opportunity of shooting a tiger. People in a neighbouring village thought of earning the price money. An old lion was around, killing domestic animals. On a moonlit night a platform was constructed. A goat was tiedd at a convenient distance. Mrs Packletide with her rifle, along with her paid companion Miss Louisa Mebbin, was on the platform, ready to shoot the tiger when it came.

The tiger came and spotted the goal. It lay flat on the earth. Being very old and perhaps ill also, it wanted some rest before attacking the prey. When the tiger began to amble towards its victim, Mrs Packletide fired a shot. The tiger sprang to one side and died. The crowd of rustics present yelled with excitement . It was Louisa Mebbin who pointed out that it was the goat that had been killed by the shot and the tiger must have died of heart failure caused by the sidden report of the rifle.

Despite of this discovery Mrs Packletide received the credit of killing the tiger. A report and her picture was published in newspaper. Loons Bimberton, however, refused to look at the newspaper, declined the luncheon-party and sent a letter to thanks to Mrs Packletide for the gift of a tiger-claw brooch. Mrs Packletide had to go gift Miss Mebbin an expensive cottage to keep her secret.

<strong>Mrs Packletide:</strong>
Mrs Packletide is a jealous, vain and boastful women. It is just out of jealousy that she plans to kill a tiger and outsmart her rival Loona Bimberton. She wants to prove her superiority over her. She dose not mind playing any price to satisfy her vanity. Her weakness is naturally exploited by Miss Mebbin who forces her to gift her a cottage to keep her secret. She is not bold to admit that she has failed to hit and kill the tiger. She wants to hog the limelight, for which she has to pay dearly. She seems to realize her folly towards the end.

<strong>Louisa Mebbin:</strong>
Louisa Mebbin is a very cunning and money-minded person. She gets paid even for giving company to Mrs Packletide. She is quite miserly. She doesn't let go money out of her hands easily. At one point she even discourages Mrs Packletide for spending thousand rupees on killing an old tiger. When the opportunity of blackmailing Mrs Packletide comes, she strikes hard and takes an expensive cottage from her for keeping her secret.

<strong>Loona Bimberton:</strong>
Loona Bimberton is also vain and boastful in nature. She continues to talk of her areil experiences as if it were her grand achievement. She is plain jealous and declines the luncheon-party to be hosted by Mrs Packletide. She knows the real intentions of her rival.

The title of the story is quite adaptive. The whole story revolves around Mrs Packletide's Tiger. The tiger which is very old and ill dies because of heart failure. However, Mrs Packletide takes the credit of 'killing' it. The tiger becomes an object of satisfying a lady's vanity.

The main idea of the story is that a person can go to any extreme to out smart his or her rival. The feelings of vanity get expressed in strange ways. In order to make Loona Bimberton low in her esteem Mrs Packletide plans to kill a tiger. A personally produced tiger-skin, she thinks, will prove her superiority over her rival. Ironically, she has to pay a very heavy price to do it. Vanity is undoubtedly a negative feeling and those who indulge in it repent sooner or later.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[सआदत अली ऐश पसंद इंसान था। कर्नल का उसे तख्त पर बिठाने का मकसद अवध की धन सम्पत्ति पर अधिकार पाना था। तख़्त पर बैठते ही उसने अंग्रेज़ों को अपनी आधी सम्पत्ति और दस लाख रूपये नगद दे दिए। इस तरह सआदत अली को गद्दी पर बैठने से अंग्रेजो लाभ ही लाभ था।]]></content:encoded>

कंपनी के वकील की हत्या करने के बाद वज़ीर अली आजमगढ़ भाग गया और वहाँ के नवाब से सहायता ली। नवाब ने उसे सुरक्षित घागरा तक पहुँचा दिया। तब से वह वहाँ के जंगलों में छुपा रहने लगा।

वज़ीर अली को उसके नवाबी पद से हटा देने पर बनारस भेज दिया गया। फिर कलकत्ता बुलाया गया तो वज़ीर अली ने कंपनी के वकील, जो बनारस में रहता था, उससे शिकायत की, परन्तु उसने शिकायत सुनने की जगह अली को खरीखोटी सुनाई। इस पर वज़ीर अली का जो गुस्सा अंग्रेजो के खिलाफ था और भी ज्यादा बढ गया और उसने इसी गुस्से में वकील का कत्ल कर दिया।

Dhumaketu (1892-1965), the pen name of Gaurishankar Govardhandas Josh, was prolific writer. He is considered to be a pioneer of the Gujarati short story. In this story the postmaster comes to realize the agony of the coachman Ali, separated from his daughter, when he finds himself in his state. The anxiety to receive some news about his ailing daughter makes him understand the anxiety of the coachman to receive a letter from his long separated daughter. He realizes how much painful the separation in love is!

<div id="story" class="accordion-body collapse">

Dhumaketu can be glorified as a prolific writer who has given a very vivid and wonderful description of the village and its people, along with the nature and loneliness of human beings. The story talks about coachman Ali who could not bear the pain of separation when his daughter left after her marriage. His loneliness gained momentum with passage of time in which he desperately waited for a letter from his daughter Miriam.

The story begins with a very vivid description of how silent the village was “wrapped in deathly silence.” The description of it being early dawn and people fast asleep in a winter morning is very well portrayed through various phrases such as “early dawn stars”, “distant steps”, “occasional bark of dogs”, etc. The old man goes to the post-office everyday occupying a particular seat with a fixed purpose - awaiting a letter from his daughter. People found him to be a lunatic and laughed at him.

In the following lines of the story we find Ali missing from the post-office for several days as he falls sick terribly. At last, he reaches the place one day and asks for the much awaited letter. The postmaster gets infuriated and chases him away. Although this angers Ali, he doesn't lose his temper. He gives five golden guineas to the postmaster to forward his letter to his grave as he considers that very day to be his last day of survival. He was never seen again.

The turning point in the story comes when trouble knocks on the postmaster's door in the form of a news about his own daughter who lay sick in another town. He was anxious about receiving a letter from her, discussing her health. He searched in the pile of letters and to his shock, found Ali's much awaited letter from his daughter. His anger disappeared in a whiff and he sent for the postman to send it to Ali right away.

The story hear turns quite heart-rendering when the postmaster feels empathy towards Ali. He is grieved because of his condition and is filled with sympathy for the old man. He then personally went to the post office to give Ali the letter. To his amazement, Ali received the letter with gratefulness and tears in his eyes. The postmaster shrunk back when he noticed a light of kindness when Ali received the letter.

The postmaster narrated this entire story to the postman. When asked on whom he saw the postmaster said he saw Ali. This is when he came to know that Ali had died three months before. Here, the bewildered postmaster found at the doorway that Ali had disappeared. Imagination had deceived him. That evening he went to Ali's grave and laid the letter there.

Empathy makes us understand each other and build strong relationships. One can feel the anxiety of other when one finds himself in that particular situation. In the end of the story, tortured with remorse and grief, the postmaster waits for news from her ill daughter, passing a restless night beside the charcoal sigri.

<strong>Ali:</strong>
Ali is the central character. He has deep love for his daughter who was married to a soldier. Separation from her makes him compassionate. He gives up hunting innocent animals. He becomes worried and anxious when he receives no letter from his daughter. He begins to visit the post office daily. Years passes but he receives no letter. His condition becomes pathetic. But such is the power of love that he becomes strong enough to withstand all words of ridicule hurled at him daily by the heartless employees of the post office. His health deteriorates and he dies one day.

<strong>Postmaster:</strong>
In the beginning, the postmaster is a heartless, callous person. He is an ill-tempered person. He loses his patience with Ali who comes to disturb them everyday in the post office. He calls him a pest. but one day he finds himself in the condition of Ali. He becomes anxious to receive the letter from his daughter who has fallen ill in the distance town. Now he realizes Ali's suffering and the value of the letter. He becomes compassionate. When he finds a letter from Ali's daughter, he puts it in reverently on Ali's grave. He is now a changed person.

The title of the story 'The Letter' is quite appropriate.I t brings home the value of the letter, symbol of ones love and concern. It begins with the coachman Ali's long anxious wait for a letter from his married daughter. Five years have passed and there is no letter. Post office employees make fun of him. But love of his daughter make him mentally strong and patient enough to withstand all their ridicules. One day he dies. The callous postmaster suddenly fonds him in Al's condition he is anxious to receive a letter from his ailing daughter. When he finds a letter from a Ali's daughter he realizes the value of a letter. A letter, he comes to understand, is not mere piece of paper. He visits Ali's grave and places the letter on it in reverence.

The subjects of his study were philosophy, politics and economics. During his stay in china, he also studied poetry and languages at Nanjing university. In the 'Frog and the Nightingale', he brings about the foolishness of following anybody blind.
']

[abpoem text='The poem "The Frog and The Nightingale" is about the contest between the frog and the nightingale. The nightingale is credulous and simple minded, whereas the frog is cunning and clever. the frog feels proud of his singing from evening till morning. He claims that he is the best singer. He arranges concerts and charges and admission fee and earns a lot of money.

The frog is surprised to hear the sweet melody of the nightingale. He fears that his position as the only singer of the bob will be threatened by the song of the nightingale. His fear comes true. All the birds listen to the songs of the nightingale and praise her very much. This makes the frog sad.

The frog feels jealous of the popularity of the nightingale. He introduces himself to the nightingale as the owner of the tree. He says that he is a music critic. He takes the nightingale into the confidence and makes an evil plan to get rid of her. He makes her sing excessively for long hours. He starts pointing out her mistakes and drawbacks. The result is that the nightingale has to bear scoldings and exploitation at the hands of the frog. She loses the beauty of her voice. The other creatures stop coming to her at the concerts arranged by the cunning frog. Ultimately, the nightingale dies after she has Brut one of her veins. The frog continues to sing in a loud, unpleasant way, now unchallenged.']

Sylvia Path (1932-1963) was born in Massachusetts on October 27, 1932. She was a small child when she lost her father. Her life was full of bad experiences. She won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1982. She was bright and intelligent. 'Mirror' reflects her concern with ageing.

The mirror is the person (speaker/narrator) of the poem. It is transparent and accurate. It truly reflects what is before it. It is free from prejudices. It is not cruel. It is only truthful. Most of the time it keeps on reflecting the blank wall with some spots opposite it, except when somebody comes before it or when there is darkness.

The mirror is like a lake of water. A woman comes and bends over it as it would bend upon a lake. She looks at her figure. Unable to face the truth, she goes away. She turns to the moon and the candles. In their dim-light she hopes to conceal the ravages of time on her face and figure. When she turns away from it, it reflects her back faithfully. The mirror gets her tears as reward. The mirror knows that the woman has lost her youth. She has been using the mirror ever since she was a young girl. Now when she comes before it, she is horrified to see an old woman rising towards her day after day like a terrible fish.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[abpoet text='

William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was born in Stratford-upon-Avon. He is regarded as the greatest dramatist of all time. He wrote 154 sonnets, too long narrative poems and about three dozen plays. He is known for his profound understanding of human nature in his plays. He has an imaginative and creative mind, but he invents few plots and stories. He simply takes an old play and old poem, and by the sheer force of his imagination, he makes it more wonderful than the old.

But in his sonnets, he expresses his own personal feelings. Most of his sonnets are remarkable for their stubble thought and exquisite expressions. Some critic regard his sonnets as mere literary exercises, but others regard them as the expression of some personal grief. Their are still other who divide his sonnets into two classes, addressed to a man who was his friend and a woman who disclaimed his love.

'कारतूस' कहानी हमें अपने देश के जाबांज और सूरमाओं की याद दिलाती है। इसके लेखक हबीब तनवीर हैं। कहीं-न-कहीं हम इन्हें भूल चूके हैं। हमारे देश की मिट्टी से जन्मे हज़ारों सूरमाओं ने अपने पराक्रम से अंग्रेज़ों को कहने पर विवश कर दिया था कि यह देश वीरों का देश है। अंग्रेज़ों ने भारत में प्रवेश किया था, तब वे एक व्यापारी थे। इन्होंने धोखे से हमारे देश पर कब्जा कर लिया। लोगों को जब तक होश आया, तब तक बहुत देर हो चुकी थी। अनेकों वीरों ने देश को स्वतंत्रता दिलाने के लिए प्रयास आरंभ किए। उन्होंने अपने साहस और पराक्रम से अंग्रेज़ों की गहरी हो चुकी नींव को हिलाकर रख दिया था। इन्हीं वीरों में से एक वीर था, लखनऊ का नवाब वज़ीर अली। उसने अग्रेज़ों के आगे घुटने टेकने से अच्छा, उनके साथ लड़ना ज्यादा बेहतर समझा। उसे गुलामी की सोने से बनी बेड़ियों से अधिक जंगलों में आज़ादी की खुली हवा अधिक प्यारी लगी। उसे पकड़ने के लिए अंग्रेज़ी सरकार जाल बुन रही थी। वे जंगलों में उसे पकड़ने के उद्देश्य से खेमा गाड़े खड़ी थी। वज़ीर अली एक निडर व्यक्ति था। वह बिना डरे कर्नल के खेमे में जा पहुँचा और उसकी नाक के नीचे से कारतूस लेकर चला गया। उसके साहस से हैरान कर्नल को भी उसके साहस की प्रशंसा करने पर विवश होना पड़ा था।

1. In asexual reproduction, certain body cells undergo repeated mitotic divisions and give rise to two or more new organisms of the same kind.

2. Different methods of asexual reproduction are — fission, budding, fragmentation, spore formation, regeneration, vegetative propagation, parthenogenesis and tissue culture.

3. Fission is a process of division of a single celled organism into two or many cells (called binary and multiple fission respectively), e.g., Amoeba.

4. Budding is a method of reproduction in which a protuberance develops on the mature organism’s body, attains full maturity and then detaches, e.g., Yeast and Hydra.

5. Spore formation : Spores are special cells formed within special structures called ‘sporangia’ that disseminate and can form the entire plant. This is exclusive to the plant kingdom, e.g., mushroom, ferns and mosses.

6. Vegetative propagation is a method of reproduction in which a vegetative plant part (i.e., a nonreproductive part or a non-flowering part) produces a new plant.

7. For artificial propagation by man, the commonly used methods are:
<ul>
	<li>Cutting in which a stem is given an oblique cut and the cut stem is kept under appropriate conditions to give rise to an entirely new plant, e.g., Rose and China rose.</li>
	<li>Layering is a process in which the stem, while still attached to the mother plant is burried under the soil for a while, till it strikes new roots. It is then detached from the mother plant, e.g., Jasmine. This is called ‘soil layering’. The other form of layering is ‘air layering’ in which incision is made on the bark of a tree and covered with moist soil. When rooting takes place in the cut portion, the entire portion is cut and used for propagation.</li>
	<li>Grafting is a process in which two parts of different plants are joined by bandaging them tightly. This allows cambial activity to unite the two portions. The one that contributes the root is called ‘stock’ and the one that contributes the shoot is known as ‘scion’. Bicoloured roses and different varieties of mangoes are made by this method.</li>
</ul>
8. Advantages of Vegetative Propagation
<ul>
	<li>It allows quicker and easy propagation.</li>
	<li>Better qualities of the plants can be maintained and the quality can even be enhanced as in seedless oranges.</li>
	<li>It results in propagation of those plants which do not produce viable seeds or produce seeds with prolonged period of dormancy.</li>
</ul>
9. Disadvantages of Vegetative Propagation

Most of these propagated plants do not produce viable seeds and hence curtail natural reproduction.

10. Regeneration is the ability of an organism to replace or repair any lost part. Sometimes, an entire organism can be made from its fragmented body, e.g., Planaria. When an unfertilised egg can be made to develop into an entire organism, it is known as ‘Parthenogenesis’ in animals and ‘Parthenocarpy’ in plants.

11. The reproductive part of a plant is its flower. A complete flower has four whorls —sepals, petals, androecium and gynoecium.

12. Male gametes are the pollen grains produced by the anther lobes and the female gametes are the ova within ovules present inside ovaries.

13. The transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma is known as pollination.

14. Pollination &gt;&gt; Self     - In same flower, In two flowers of same plant
&gt;&gt; Cross  - Transfer of pollen from anther to the stigma of different flower of different plants but of same species.

15. Upon pollination, pollen gets deposited on the stigma. The pollen germinates by forming pollen tubes. Each tube carries two male nuclei at its tip.

16. The ovary bears ovules. The number of ovules vary from one (as in mango) to many (as in orchid).

17. During syngamy, the first male nucleus fuses with the ovum to form the zygote. The second male nucleus fuses with the polar nucleus to form the endosperm.

18. The entire process is summarised as “double fertilisation” and triple fusion.

19. The fertilised ovule develops into a seed and the fertilised ovary into the fruit.

20. Sexual reproduction necessarily requires two gametes usually different from one another. Male gamete is the spermatozoa and female gamete is the ovum.

21. In most animals single individual produces only one type of gamete and hence is unisexual. However, there are organisms that possess both testicles and ovaries and are called bisexuals or hermaphrodites, e.g., earthworm and leech.

22. The fusion of the two gametes is known as ‘fertilisation’.

23. Sexual reproduction provides wider scope for variation between the parents and the offsprings.

24. Male reproductive system in human consists of the following organs —
<ul>
	<li>Testes in the scrotum</li>
	<li>Epididymis</li>
	<li>Vas deferens</li>
	<li>Urethra</li>
	<li>Penis</li>
	<li>Accessory glands (seminal vesicle and prostrate gland)</li>
</ul>
25. Female reproductive system in humans consists of the following organs —
<ul>
	<li>Ovaries</li>
	<li>Fallopian tubes or oviducts</li>
	<li>Uterus or womb</li>
	<li>Vagina</li>
</ul>
26. The attainment of sexual maturity is known as puberty.

27. The gonads control and regulate three major functions :
<ul>
	<li>Produce the gametes as well as the sex hormones (testosterone is produced by the testicles and estrogen and progesterone by the ovaries).</li>
	<li>They help in the functioning of the accessory sex organs (i.e., organs which are part of the reproductive system but do not directly produce gametes).</li>
	<li>They help in the development of secondary sex characters like breast development in girls and growth of facial hair in boys.</li>
</ul>
28. In male the testicles are lodged in the scrotum outside the body as the process of sperm formation requires a temperature lower than the normal body temperature. The other parts of this system are :
<ul>
	<li>Vas deferens</li>
	<li>Urethra, a common passage for the release of urine as well as sperms. Testicles function throughout the life of a man, from puberty onwards, though the quality of the sperms declines with age.</li>
</ul>
29. The female puberty is considered to be attained with the first menstrual discharge and this is called ‘Menarche’. The stoppage of menstruation marks the end of the reproductive life in females and is known as ‘Menopause’.

30. The ovaries at birth contain groups of cells called follicles, which mature one at a time throughout the reproductive life of a female in a cyclical manner. Out of a group of follicles only one matures as an ovum or egg. The other cells in the group serve as nourishers. Upon attaining maturity the egg is expelled into the oviduct also known as the fallopian tube.

31. Population control involves measures by which fertilisation is prevented. The three common methods are :
<ul>
	<li>Physical barrier methods like condoms or placing of IUCDs (Intra Uterine Contraceptive Devices) in the uterus of the female.</li>
	<li>Chemical methods like use of oral or vaginal pills.</li>
	<li>Surgical methods which involves a reversible surgery in which the tubes conducting the gametes are cut and tied. It is known as vasectomy in males and tubectomy in females.</li>
</ul>
32. STDs are sexually transmitted diseases, also called Veneral Diseases (VDs). They are transmitted from the infected individuals to healthy ones during sexual contacts. Gonorrhoea and syphilis are common STDs. AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is also transmitted by sexual contact. Responsible sexual behaviour and prudence can help to prevent the spread of STDs. Both government (National Population Policy and National Health Policy) and non-government organisations are endeavouring to control the fertility rate.

<strong>1. What is the importance of DNA coping in reproduction?</strong>

Ans. Importance of DNA coping in reproduction is that the characteristics, of the parent organisms are transmitted to its offspring and at the sometime some occasional variations are also produced in the offspring.

<strong>2. Why is variation beneficial to the species but not necessarily for the individual?</strong>

Ans. Variation is beneficial to the species as it helps in the survival of a few individual under extreme conditions when the rest of the population is wiped out. Hod this variation not been there, the population in a niche would be wiped out, if the niche were drastically altered. Thus, this variation ensures the survival of the species.

<strong>3. How does binary fission differ from multiple fission?</strong>

Ans. When two new daughter cells are formed as a result of fission, it Is called binary fission, e.g. Amoeba. When multiple daughter cells are formed as a result of fission, it is called multiple fission, e.g. malarial parasite.

<strong>4. How will an organism be benefited if it reproduces through spores?</strong>

Ans. An organism is benefited if it reproduces through spores as spores formation is an asexual form of reproduction and the organism does not need a partner to reproduce. Also, the offspring’s produced are multiple that can spread out far.

<strong>5. Can you think of reasons why more complex organisms cannot give rise to new individuals through regeneration?</strong>

Ans. Complex organisms have specialized cells, tissues and organs that have to be placed at definite positions in the body. In such complexly organisms, it is not easy to develop new organisms through regenerations. Hence, complex organisms through regeneration.

<strong>6. Why is vegetation propagation practiced for growing some types of plants?</strong>

Ans. Vegetation propagation through methods like layering, grafting, etc. allows the plants raised to bear flowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. This is why vegetative propagation is practised for growing some types of plants.

<strong>7. Why is DNA copying an essential part of the process of reproduction?</strong>

Ans. DNA contains information for making some specialize protein that lead to the body design and structure. Thus DNA coping ensures that the offspring has a body design similar to that of the parent. Thus, in turn fulfills one of the aims of reproduction, i.e., to produce similar organisms.

<strong>8. How is the process of pollination different from fertilization?</strong>

Ans. Pollination refers to the transfer of pollen grains from the anther the stigma by agents like air and water. On the other hand, fertilization refers to the fusion of male and female germ cell into zygote that later develops into a seed in plants.

<strong>9. What is the role of the seminal vesicle’s and prostate gland?</strong>

Ans. The seminal vesicle’s and the prostate gland secrete fluids into the vas defers that help in easy movement of the sperms and provides them nourishment.

<strong>10. What are the changes seen in girls at the time of puberty?</strong>

Ans. Various changes take place in girls at the time of puberty. Thick hair grows in the armpits and the genital area between the thighs, which ca also become darker in colour. The breast size begins to increase, with the darkening of skin of the nipples at the tip of the breasts. Girls also begin to menstruate at around this time.

<strong>11. How does the embryo get nourishment inside the mother’s body?</strong>

Ans. The embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s body through the placenta. It is dose embedded in the uterine wall with villi on the embryos’ side which absorb glucose and oxygen from the blood spaces that surround them on the mother’s side.

<strong>12. If a woman is using copper-T, will it help in protecting her from sexually transmitted diseases?</strong>

Ans:- No using copper-T will not provide protection from sexually transmitted diseases, as it does not prevent the entry of semen, It only prevents the implantation of the embryo in the uterus

<strong>13. What are the advantages of sexual reproduction over asexually reproduction?</strong>

Ans:- The advantages of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction are

(1). as the DNA is inherited from two different parents, more variations are produced, ensuring the species survival

(2). Variations are more available in sexual mode them in asexual

(3). the organism formed has the, characteristics of both the parents

<strong>14. What are the functions performed by the testis in human being?</strong>

Ans. In human being, the testis produces sperms or the male germs cells. It is main male reproductive organ.it also secretes the hormone, testosterone that brings about secondary sexual characteristics in human males.

<strong>15. Why does menstruation occur?</strong>

Ans.  When the ovary release an egg, the uterus prepares itself to receive the egg. The living become thick and spongy to nourish the embryo if fertilization takes place .however if the egg is not fertilized, the lining berks and come out of the vagina as blood and mucous known as menstruation. This why menstruation takes place.

<strong>16. What are the different methods of contraception?</strong>

Ans. The different methods of contraception are:

1)   Physical: condoms on penis or similar devices worn in the vagina create a physical or mechanical barrier so that the sperm does not reach the egg other devices like the loop and copper-T placed in the uterus prevent the implantation of the embryo in the uterus.

2)    Chemical: use of contraception pills change the hormonal balance of the body so that the eggs are not released.

3)   Surgical: Surgical methods like male vasectomy and female tubectomy create blocks in the vas defer the fallopian tubes and prevent the release of sperms or eggs from the testes or the ovary.

<strong>17. What could the reason for adopting contraceptive methods?</strong>

Ans. There could be various reasons for adopting contra captive methods:
<ol>
	<li>To prevent unwanted pregnancies</li>
	<li> To protect oneself from sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, HIV-AIDS etc.</li>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>How did Frederic Sorrieu depicted the utopian vision in his paintings ?
OR
How did the French artist Frederic Sorrieu visualized in his first print of series of four prints visualizing his dream of a world made up of 'Democratic and Social Republics'.</strong>

Ans:
<ul>
	<li>The first print of the series, shows the peoples of Europe and America – men and women of all ages and social classes – marching in a long train, and offering homage to the statue of Liberty as they pass by it.</li>
	<li>A female figure was shown with the torch of Enlightenment in one hand and Charter of Rights of Man in another hand.</li>
	<li>On the earth in the foreground of the image lie the shattered remains of the symbols of absolutist institutions.</li>
	<li>In Sorrieu’s utopian vision, the peoples of the world are grouped as distinct nations, identified through their flags and national costume.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: normal;">'टोपी शुक्ला' कहानी प्रेम के महत्व का वर्णन करती है। इस कहानी में लेखक राही मासूम रज़ा ने बताने का प्रयास किया है कि प्रेम जाति, धर्म, और उम्र के बधनों से परे है। प्रेम एक सुंदर भावना है। उसके सामने हर दुर्भावना और दुख निष्फल हो जाता है। </span></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: normal;">टोपी, इफ़्फ़न का मित्र है। इफ़्फ़न शहर के कलेक्टर का पुत्र है और मुस्लिम परिवार से है। टोपी ब्राह्मण है परंतु दोनों के लिए पद और धर्म का कोई महत्व नहीं है। वे दोनों पक्के मित्र हैं। यही उनकी पहचान है। </span></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: normal;">वहीं इफ़्फ़न की दादी उम्र दराज़ महिला हैं। टोपी और उनके बीच घनिष्ट संबंध है। टोपी, इफ़्फ़न के घर सिर्फ उसकी दादी से मिलने जाता है। टोपी की अपनी दादी भी है। परंतु उनसे उन्हें कभी प्रेम और स्नेह की कोमल छाया नहीं मिली। मिला है तो डाँट, अविश्वास और अपमान। इफ़्फ़न की दादी उसे अपनी दादी से ज्यादा प्यारी लगती है। उसे इस बात से कोई सरोकार नहीं है कि वह मुस्लिम है। उसके लिए तो वह संसार की सबसे प्यारी दादी है।</span></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: normal;">लेखक इस कहानी में टोपी शुक्ला के माध्यम से यह प्रश्न उठाते हैं कि समाज में क्या ज्यादा महत्वपूर्ण है, प्रेम, धर्म, जाति या कुछ और। इस कहानी ने अपनी बात को बहुत सुंदर ढ़ग से व्यक्त किया है।</span></span></div>]]></content:encoded>

इफ़्फ़न की दादी मौलवी की बेटी न होकर ज़मीदार की बेटी थीं। अपने पीहर में वह दूध, घी, दही खाती थीं। लखनऊ आकर वह इसके लिए तरस जाती क्योंकि यहाँ उन्हें मौलविन बन कर रहना पड़ता था। इसलिए उन्हें पीहर जाना अच्छा लगता था।

<ol>
	<li>Cornea is a transparent protective membrane such that it covers the front portion of an eye. It is that portion of an eye which is visible from outside.</li>
	<li>Aqueous humour is the viscous liquid inside eye which lies between cornea and eye lens. It converges most of the light ray entering the eye.</li>
	<li>Iris is the coloured part in our eye. It is a muscular diaphragm that controls the size of pupil. In low light condition, it expands the size of pupil so that more light enters the eye through pupil while in good light condition, it contracts the size of pupil so that less light enters the eye through pupil.</li>
	<li>Pupil is a small hole in iris. It appears black because any light falling on it goes into the eye and the amount of light entering the eye is controlled by changing the size of pupil with the help of iris.</li>
	<li>Crystalline Lens is a lens of adjustable focal length inside eye, so as to focus objects placed at different distances.</li>
	<li>Ciliary Muscles alter the curvature of lens.</li>
	<li>Retina is the place where light entering the eye forms the real and inverted image of an object. It consists of about 125 million cells, called rods and cones which receive the light and about one million opticnerve fibres through which the information is transmitted to the brain. The function of rod cells is to respond to the brightness of light while function of cone cells is to respond to the colours and also to distinguish between various colours.</li>
	<li>Vitreous Humour is the fluid in between the lens and the retina.</li>
	<li>The cornea-lens-fluid system is known as eye-lens or single converging lens whose focal length is adjusted with the help of ciliary muscles.</li>
	<li>Yellow Spot is at about centre of the retina and is most sensitive to the light.</li>
	<li>Blind Spot is the point at which the optic nerve enters the eye. It is insensitive to the light. In other words blind spot is the area of zero vision.</li>
	<li>The size of object as sensed by human eye depends on its visual angle. Visual angle is the angle (8) subtended by object on eye as shown in the given figure. As object is brought nearer to eye, visual angle increases and hence size of image will increase.<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-134" style="border-style: initial;border-color: initial" src="http://nxtclass.cu.cc/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Untitled1.png" alt="" width="402" height="187" /></li>
	<li>The ability of eye to see objects from infinity ( far point) to 25 cm (near point) is called "power of accommodation." or the ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called power of accommodation.</li>
	<li>If object is at infinity, parallel beam of light enters the eye and in this condition eye is least strained and said to be 'relaxed' or 'unstrained'.If object is at least distance of distinct vision (near paint), eye is under maximum strain and visual angle is maximum.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>Working of The Eye</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">When ray of light coming from the object enter the pupil of the eye and falls on the eye lens as shown in figure, it converges the light rays and produces a real and inverted image of the object on the retina. The image formed on the retina is conveyed to the brain by the optic nerve and gives rise to the sensation of vision.</p>
Image formation of an object on retina

<strong>Terms regarding Human Eye</strong>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Fovea </strong>central is : The centre of the retina. The region of the highest visual activity and cone cells density.</li>
	<li><strong>Vitreous gel (body) </strong>: A clear jelly like substance which fills the posterior chamber of the eye ball.</li>
	<li><strong>Macula lutea </strong>: The area in and around the fovea made up mostly of cone cells. It is responsible for central vision and contains the fovea.</li>
	<li><strong>Sclera: </strong>The white dense, fibrous outer coating of the eye ball.</li>
	<li><strong>Iris: </strong>The coloured diaphragm in the anterior chamber of the eye ball which contracts and expands to adjust for light intensity.</li>
	<li><strong>Occulomot</strong><strong>or </strong><strong>mus</strong><strong>cles: </strong>Muscles that move the eyes in all directions.</li>
	<li><strong>Pink eye </strong>: Conjuctivitis.</li>
	<li><strong>Macular degeneration </strong>: A condition when rods and cones degenerate with age.</li>
	<li><strong>Constriction: </strong>When the pupil is very narrow to allow minimum light in.</li>
	<li><strong>Glaucoma: </strong>A condition where internal pressure damages the optic nerve.</li>
	<li><strong>Stye:</strong> An infection of the sebaceous glands of the eyelid.</li>
	<li><strong>Dilation:</strong> When the pupil is wide open to allow maximum light in.</li>
	<li><strong>Opthamologist:</strong> A doctor to consult for an eye condition.</li>
	<li><strong>Optometrist:</strong> A specialist who prescribes eye glasses.</li>
	<li><strong>Blind spot:</strong> If an image is formed on this region of retina, it is not sensed and hence, the object is not seen. There are no rods or cones at this spot where optic nerve leaves the eye ball.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Defects of Vision</strong>

<strong></strong>This occurs when a person is not able to see the Objects distinctly and comfortably without strain on eyes.  It is due to the optical defects of the eye.

<strong>Myopia (Short-sightedness or Near-sightedness)</strong>

In this defect, person is not able to see the distant Objects clearly, however he can see nearby objects clearly.
<ol type="i">
	<li>In this defect, far point O is closer than infinity.</li>
	<li>This defect arises due to increase in aperture of eye-ball or decrease in focal length of eye lens.</li>
	<li>In this defect, the image of parallel rays from distant object is formed in front of retina (figure (ii)).</li>
	<li>This defect can be removed by using spectacles having diverging (concave) lens. P-urpose of using the lens is to produce the image at the far point of object at infinity (figure (iii)).</li>
	<li>Power of lens needed to correct defect is <em>P </em>= <span style="text-decoration: underline"> 1  </span> = <span style="text-decoration: underline"> 1  </span> [Here F is far point in metre]                                                                                                                                                                                           .                                                                                            f         -F</li>
</ol>
<strong>Hypermetropia or Hyperopia (Long-sightedness or Far-sightedness)</strong>

<strong></strong>In this defect, person is not able to see the nearby objects clearly, however he can see the distant objects clearly.
<ol type="i">
	<li>In this defect, near point <em>N </em>is greater than 25 cm (tV) (figure (i)).</li>
	<li>This defect arises due to decrease in aperture of eye-ball or increase in focal length of eye-lens.</li>
	<li>In this defect, the image (i) of nearby objects <em>N </em>is formed behind the retina of the eye (figure (ii)).</li>
	<li>This defect can be removed by using spectacles having converging (convex) lens. Purpose of using the lens is to produce the image at the near point <em>N </em>of object at <em>N </em>(figure (iii)).</li>
	<li>Power of lens needed to correct the defect is <em>P </em>=<span style="text-decoration: underline">  1  </span>= [ <span style="text-decoration: underline">_1_</span> - <span style="text-decoration: underline">_1_</span> ] or <em>P </em>= (4 - <span style="text-decoration: underline">   1   </span> ). [Here N.P. (Nearpoint) should be in metre].                                                                                        .                                                                                                    <em>f       </em>0.25   N.P.                        N.P.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Presbyopia </strong>
<ol type="i">
	<li>The power of accommodation of the eye usually decreases with ageing. For most people, the near point gradually recedes away. Presbyopia is a special kind of hypermetropia.</li>
	<li>Presbyopic person finds it difficult to see nearby objects comfortably and distinctly.</li>
	<li>This defect usually occurs in old age because of gradual weakening of the ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of eye-lens and thereby ciliary muscles lose their elasticity and so can not change the focal length of eye-lens effectively.</li>
	<li>Sometimes, a person may suffer from both myopia and hypermetropia. This defect can be corrected by using spectacles having bifocal lenses such that the lower portion of the bifocal lens is a convex lens for seeing nearby objects and the upper portion of the bifocal lens is a concave lens for seeing distant objects.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Astigmatism </strong>
<ol type="i">
	<li>In this defect, person is not able to focus on both horizontal as well as vertical lines simultaneously.</li>
	<li>This defect occurs due to imperfect spherical nature of eye-lens and that's why the focal length of eye-lens in two perpendicular directions becomes different.</li>
	<li>This defect can be corrected by using spectacles having cylindrical lens in a particular direction.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Need and Why?</strong>
<ol type="i">
	<li>Helps study chemistry of elements systematically.</li>
	<li>Need not remember the properties of all elements seperately but only those of groups and periods.</li>
	<li>Helps understand the gradual change of properties.</li>
	<li>Helps understand relationship between different classes of elements.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Early classifications:-</strong>
<ul>
	<li>On basis on Metals or Non Metals:-</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Shortcomings-</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>too general,</li>
	<li>could not explain the metallic properties of some non metals.</li>
	<li>On Basis of Valency:-</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Shortcomings:-</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>could not explain the variable valency of single element.</li>
	<li>Elements with same valency have different properties.</li>
	<li>Dobereiner's Triads (By J. Dobereiner):-
<ul>
	<li>Proposed in 1817.</li>
	<li>3 elements were grouped together according to their atomic mass. The atomic mass of the middle element is approximately equal to the average of the masses of the extreme elements of the groups.</li>
	<li>There is gradation in properties of elements of these triads. eg:-</li>
	<li>Li &lt; Na &lt; K : in respect of displacing H from H<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
	<li>Cl &gt; Br &gt; I : in respect of displacing each other from their compounds.</li>
	<li>Ca &lt; Sr &lt; Ba : in respect of displacing H from H<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
	<li>Thus, the middle element of a triad has an intermediate atomic mass and is properties lie between those elements.</li>
	<li>Shortcomings:- All elements cannot be classified.</li>
	<li>Property Explored:- Relation between atomic mass and properties of elements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Newland's Law of Octaves (By John Newland):-</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Proposed in 1866.</li>
	<li>Newland's Law of Octaves:- When elements are arranged in the order of their increasing atomic masses, the properties of every eighth element is a repetition of the first one.</li>
	<li>Shortcomings:-</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Was applicable only till Calcium as after that every 8th element was not similar to the first one.</li>
	<li>Several elements were discovered that did not fit into the Newland's Law of Octaves.</li>
	<li>To fit elements in the table two elements (Co &amp; Ni)were put in 1 slot in a column of unlike elements(Cl, F, Br and I).</li>
	<li>Iron (Fe) which resembles Co and Ni in properties, was placed far fr0m them.</li>
	<li>Dobereiner's triads also exist in Newland's Classification of elements.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Mendeleev's Periodic Table (The Original Periodic Table):-</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Mendeleev's Periodic Law:- Proposed in 1869, this law states that properties of elements are dependent on their atomic mass and this dependence is periodic.</li>
	<li>Periodic Table:- Devised in 1869, it was arranged in order of increasing atomic mass. Some places were left for unknown elements, eg.- Scandium; Noble gases later added as a separate column at the end of 19th Century.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Main Features:-</li>
<ol type="a">
	<li><strong>Groups and Subgroups </strong>are the columns in the periodic table represented by Roman Numeral I-VIII.</li>
	<li>Each group is <strong>divided in two subgroups</strong>, A &amp; B which are single columned.</li>
	<li><strong>Group VIII B contains 3 sets</strong> of elements each: Fe, Co, Ni.</li>
	<li><strong>Group VIII A has Noble gases</strong>.</li>
	<li>Elements in any subgroup resemble each other.</li>
	<li>Elements of <strong>Subgroup A don't resemble those in Subgroup B</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Periods</strong> are the rows which comprise of the entire range of elements after which properties repeat. Represented by Arabic numerals 1-7.</li>
</ol>
	<li>Usefulness:-</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Valency</strong>:- Elements in a group have the same valency, that changes gradually in a period.</li>
<ul>
	<li>In respect to H -&gt; Rises from 1 to 4 and then falls 4 to 1 gradually moving from left to right.</li>
	<li>In respect to O -&gt; Maximum valency is the same as the group number.</li>
</ul>
	<li>Correction of atomic mass:- Atomic mass of an element is found out by formula: atomic mass = equivalent mass x valency.</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>
